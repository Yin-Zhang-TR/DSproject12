Although the return of Richie Gray will ameliorate the problem, they still need a human hammer in the back row to prevent the sort of breakdown break-up they suffered against the bully boy Bokke last weekend. Blade Thomson and Sam Skinner are a different breed but it would have been instructive to see Gary Graham play against South Africa or, indeed, anyone.', '2 Low scoring games still offer plenty of drama', 'The wet weather helped keep a lid on things but the most compelling drama came largely from low scoring games. Wales/Australia failed to produce a single try in 80 minutes but not too many fans left the Principality Stadium early. In similar fashion the Ireland/All Black encounter was none the worse for being decided by the game’s only try that fell to Jacob Stockdale. ']**

And it’s certainly true that those who enter the profession can expect many weeks of annual leave.', 'But the reality for those working in schools across Scotland is that they are working in ever more difficult circumstances. Budget cuts and staff shortages mean teachers are under intense pressure, often without the support they need. Meanwhile, a lack of teachers in key subject areas leaves pupils short-changed. ', 'The Scotsman today reports that nearly 3,000 teaching posts have had to be re-advertised over the past three years after initial searches failed to find suitable candidates.', 'First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she wishes to be judged on her Government’s stewardship of the Scottish education system and, in fairness to her, she has made demonstrable efforts to improve the current situation.', 'However, the fact remains that in schools across the country, teachers are working longer hours than ever for rewards that can’t begin to compete with the sort of salaries experts in - for example - the sciences could expect to receive in industry. It is also, unfortunately, the case that budget cuts mean many teachers feel compelled to pay for books and equipment that are no longer supplied as a matter of course.']**

['The scriptwriters of The Girl in the Spider’s Web have turned Stieg Larsson’s compelling and complex Lisbeth Salander into a franchise-seeking action hero – and squandered the talent of Claire Foy in the process', 'The Girl in the Spider’s Web (15) *', 'Assassination Nation (18) ***', 'Shoplifters (15) ****', 'Vacuum-packing more stupidity into two hours than a mid-period Bond flick, The Girl in the Spider’s Web dumbs down everything that was great or interesting about Stieg Larsson’s The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series and turns it into a grim, self-serious, avenging angel-style comic book fantasy. A soft reboot of David Fincher’s underappreciated adaptation of Larsson’s first book in the Millennium trilogy, and based on David Lagercrantz’s contentious 2015 novel continuing the series, the new film replaces Rooney Mara with Clare Foy as “righter of wrongs” Lisbeth Salander and, as a consequence of not being able to entice Daniel Craig back either, downgrades the role of investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist (now played Sverrir Gudnason) to little more than a cameo.

['What’s life really like in a globe-trotting, festival-topping, China-touring five-piece? Fiona Shepherd finds out', 'Since their formative days on Glasgow’s DIY indie scene, Franz Ferdinand have always been the band you want playing at your party. Their earliest gigs were at a series of now-legendary private-ish arty party nights they would throw in the ironically named Chateau, a rundown warehouse space just south of the Clyde. But they were destined for much bigger happenings – not least Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, which was quick to spot their potential and booked them to open the Concert in the Gardens in 2003.', 'Drummer Paul Thomson reckons this would have been about their 15th gig as a band – had it not been cancelled due to wild weather. Undeterred, the band went searching for an alternative gig that night and appropriately pitched up at a house party. “It was very last minute,” recalls Thomson. “I think there was a band that rehearsed in the flat so we just used all their gear. We were psyched up to play so we were desperately looking for another party.”', 'Thomson was particularly keen to return to Edinburgh’s Hogmanay – this time at the top of the bill – because of the many times he attended the street party as a teenager.', '“The motivation for going into town in Edinburgh was to try to meet new people,” he recalls. “Everybody always seemed to be a lot friendlier on Hogmanay, probably because they were drunk. Obviously I picked up on that as a kid from going to Hogmanay parties at my grandparents’. Everybody is inexplicably very happy, having a great time, what’s going on here?”']**

['The skills Heather Holliday honed in Coney Island sideshows have made her a true star at La Clique Noël, Kelly Apter discovers', 'Heather Holliday first trained to be a sword- swallower at New York’s famous Coney Island fair. Aged just 17 at the time, she undertook a gruelling summer of back-to-back performances. “Coney Island will always be what I’m most proud of,” she says. “I was part of a sideshow that was performed over and over again, in order to keep customers quickly moving in and out. And if the boardwalk was bustling, you could do ten shows in one day – 50 shows a week. It’s basically sideshow boot camp and you can’t get that kind of performance experience anywhere else.”', 'One of eight diverse acts on the bill at La Clique Noël – Part Deux, the flagship show of Edinburgh’s Christmas, Holliday has been swallowing steel – and fire – ever since. Fear, it would seem, isn’t part of her make-up.', '“You don’t get into sideshows to conquer your fears – you get into them because you want to learn how to do stuff that shouldn’t be possible,” she says.', ' “I was just a teenager when I started this and jumped at everything with reckless abandon. I knew the dangers but was honestly never afraid, I was full of intrigue.”']**
Theatre interview: Ella Hickson on reimagining Peter Pan for Edinburgh’s Royal Lyceum**

https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/theatre/theatre-interview-ella-hickson-on-reimagining-peter-pan-for-edinburgh-s-royal-lyceum-1-4835387
['Ten years, 12 major plays, and dozens of other writing projects; it’s been a busy decade for award-winning playwright Ella Hickson since she first shot to fame in 2008 with her remarkable Edinburgh Fringe show Eight, which played to rave reviews at the Bedlam Theatre. At the time, Hickson had just graduated from Edinburgh University with a degree in art history and English literature; but when Eight – a series of short monologues in which each day’s programme was selected by the audience in a ballot based on brief descriptions of the characters – won a Scotsman Fringe First Award, followed by a Carol Tambor Award transfer to New York and then a run in London, her post-university fate was sealed. At 23, she became the youngest playwright ever published by theatrical imprint Nick Hern Books; and within half a decade, she had written major plays for the Old Vic and the Royal Shakespeare Company, among many others.', 'As for most young playwrights, her reviews were mixed; her 2016 epic Oil, for the Almeida Theatre in London, about a vast sweep of female history in the age of growing carbon-fuelled wealth, divided audiences and critics between breathless admiration for its ambition and questions about how well it worked out in detail. Then, earlier this year, Hickson caught the #metoo moment with her latest play The Writer, based on her personal experience of how even successful women writers can still be patronised, bullied and pushed out of shape by a male-dominated system. The play struck a profound chord in the theatrical world of 2018, and became one of the most discussed London theatre events of the year, winning a Best New Play nomination in this month’s Evening Standard awards.', 'So it’s with something like a sigh of relief that Hickson turns back, this Christmas, to a play she wrote for the Royal Shakespeare Company more than five years ago, and to the city where she first found her voice as a student playwright. Her version of JM Barrie’s great, disturbing Peter Pan story – retitled Wendy and Peter Pan – is this year’s Christmas show at the Lyceum Theatre, opening next week; and it’s hardly surprising, given Hickson’s feminist history, that it places the character of Wendy Darling – the little girl invited to Neverland to mother the lost boys – firmly at the centre of the story. ', '“Peter Pan is actually quite a difficult story to make into a successful play,” says Hickson, reflecting on the slightly shorter version she has created for the Lyceum, reducing the show’s cast size from 21 to 12. “For one thing, it’s very dark. I was aware of the story of Barrie’s brother who drowned when he was very young; and right from the start I felt that it was about grief – it’s almost a kind of manual for grief for young readers.', '“It also has this structural issue, in that its main character is a boy who refuses to grow up, and therefore never evolves, never changes. So I thought it would be more interesting to put Wendy at the centre of the story – because she does develop and change through the story, in very interesting ways.']**

Music review: Lauryn Hill, Glasgow Hydro**

['For anyone who has read only the press reports of Lauryn Hill’s recent European tour, her most high-profile jaunt of recent times, the temptation might have been to write off this show before it had even begun. Tales came from France of Hill appearing onstage two hours after her scheduled time and then only playing for a little over half an hour; such had her infamy built in this regard that, when she’d exceeded her billed onstage time of 9.20pm at the Hydro by even ten minutes, people were gleefully jumping on to Twitter to feed the outrage machine.', 'Lauryn Hill, Glasgow Hydro ***', 'Presumably never having experienced a show involving the Libertines’ Pete Doherty or Guns N’ Roses’ Axl Rose before, they would hopefully still have realised that Hill’s eventual arrival at 10pm wasn’t so bad in the grand scheme of things, especially not when the artist in question has built a stratospheric reputation on the back of a relatively slim output. The New Jersey-born singer’s success came first as a low-level film actor in the early 1990s, and then as the lead singer of the Fugees, whose 1996 album was a Grammy-winning international success.', 'This tour, however, celebrates her major achievement under her own name – the release in 1998 of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, her only solo album yet one which instantly lodged itself as a contender for the finest of the decade. Fusing classic soul, contemporary rap and light-touch political consciousness, its reputation has travelled well enough to allow Hill to pack a 12,000-capacity arena like the Hydro on its strength alone.', 'For those making the comment afterwards that just to see and hear her was enough, this show was certainly not a disappointment. She and her full live band played for 75 minutes in total, the house lights being put up prematurely three minutes before she finally walked offstage at quarter past 11; and while the overrun sapped a little of the drama from the finale, she was in the midst of performing the Fugees’ big hit Ready or Not at the time, with big hits including The Miseducation’s Everything is Everything, Ex-Factor and Doo-Wop (That Thing) already behind her.']**
