      "  In the foyer of the European Court of Justice building in Luxembourg there's a copy of Eduardo Paolozzi's statue of Sir Isaac Newton, on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland. Curiously, the artist signed it on the reverse. Which means that the first thing the august judges of Europe's supreme court see upon arriving for work is Newton's backside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It's a posture that would appeal to Boris Johnson. He too wants to give the ECJ the bum's rush. He regards the court as an instrument of “colonial” domination, imposing an alien legal code on Britain. The main reason he wants to “chuck Chequers” is because Theresa May's latest Brexit plan leaves the European Court of Justice as the ultimate authority on trade disputes. Actually, on this at least, the bouffant Brexiteer is correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It's more complicated, of course, everything to do with Brexit is. The latest backstop proposal for resolving the Irish border problem seems to involve Britain remaining in the Customs Union for an indefinite period and for Northern Ireland to remain in regulatory alignment with the European Single Market. Brussels insiders, like the Labour MEP, David Martin, of the parliament's International Trade Committee, believe a deal along these lines has already been done behind the scenes. It remains only for the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, to announce it, in great fanfare, this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But if my soundings in Brussels are correct, there is almost zero chance of it being agreed – at least by the Brexiteers. This is because, if Britain remains even partially in the single market and the Customs Union under the so called “hybrid backstop”, that leaves the UK still subject to the European Court of Justice. And these people don't mess about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The top legal adviser to the European Court, Advocate-General Eleanor Sharpston is about as tough as they get - she's a karate black-belt for a start. She made it clear that there's no bucking the ECJ. “This court decides what the single market rules are, and that isn't going to change”. Theresa May can try to claim that Britain is not under the “direct jurisdiction” of the ECJ – perhaps by having the UK Supreme Court act as intermediary – but the inescapable legal reality is that it is. The ultimate arbiter for disputes about the European Single Market and the Customs Union is the Luxembourg bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Boris Johnson understands this. He says that, under this week’s proposed deal: “We cannot escape the EU laws and ECJ until they allow us to – which they may never do”. He goes on to say that this makes Britain a “colony” which is of course ridiculous. There is a world of difference between a court that deals with disputes over trade and related matters, and the supreme legal authority of a nation state.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Whenever countries join a rules-based international trading system they agree to share sovereignty. The World Trade Organisation , the hard Brexiteers' hard backstop, also has an arbitration procedure. The European Free Trade Association, has a court. Thai doesn't mean that members of EFTA or the WTO cease to be independent countries. Perhaps the greatest mistake made by Theresa May in these entire negotiations has been to go along with the fiction that Brexit means “taking back our laws”. We never lost them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Even the UK government's own White Paper on Brexit made this clear in February 2017 when it said that the UK parliament “remained sovereign throughout our membership of the EU”. It went on to say that “it didn't always feel like that”, but the constitutional situation has never been in doubt. We never lost control of our laws, except in very narrowly defined areas. The demonising of the European Court of Justice has been a disastrous error of rhetoric, which has led many people to believe the canard that – as the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt put it at the Tory Conference in Birmingham– the EU is a “prison” like the old “Soviet Union” from which Britain is “escaping”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  This equation of the EU with the USSR, which has become commonplace among Tory eurosceptics, has caused genuine outrage across the European Union – especially in central European countries which actually experienced soviet domination. Try suggesting to someone from a Baltic state, like Lithuania, that the EU is prison. They'll tell you, forcefully, that it was the European Union that helped them escape from communist domination. First by giving them a model of freedom, prosperity and human rights, and second by allowing them to become members of a union founded on the autonomy of independent nations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a palpable change of mood in Brussels last week following the rhetoric of that Tory conference. Britain's friends in the Brussels have mostly given up trying to defend UK ministers. Officials, politicians, and Brussels commissioners just want an end to this whole demeaning Brexit process – and they don't much care how. They've other, more important things on their minds, like populism, Italy, Putin, Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  And I have to say, there’s very little support in Brussels for Nicola Sturgeon's call to delay the implementation of Article 50 next March. That would need the agreement of all 27 remaining states and officials now believe that is most unlikely. This is partly because EU governments just refuse to prolong the agony. This week's deal looks final.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  And it poses very serious problems for Scotland. If Northern Ireland remains in the single market, this will be a huge attraction for firms wishing to gain the benefits of working within the EU without leaving the UK. It gives the North a massive competitive advantage over Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon is right to demand parity. But there's no way she is going to get it. Senior Brussels commissioners dismiss out of hand the idea of Scotland getting a similar deal. They won't even talk about it – I've tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  There is some sympathy in the European Parliament for Scotland’s plight: being forced out of the EU against its will. According to David Martin, there's now a real willingness to help Scotland rejoin the EU, if it were to become independent. But that is very much for the future. The EU only deals with member states, in this case the UK, and right now they just want rid the lot of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  My problem is that I can't see how the UK parliament can endorse this week's hybrid backstop. It may well be that a technical solution to the issue of Irish border checks is not far off. There are already health and environmental checks on agricultural goods and food coming from Northern Ireland to Britain. This could be the basis for a future “frictionless border” between Northern Ireland, which remains partially in the single market, and the UK which remains largely out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But the DUP are having none of it. Britain remaining for an indefinite period in the Customs Union is a non-starter for Tory Brexiteers. The SNP must oppose NI exceptionalism and Chequers2 doesn't meet Labour’s “six tests”. Britain’s been asking for the impossible. If you remain even partially in regulatory alignment you must accept ECJ rulings. As with Paolozzi's statue, that's the bottom line.\n",

      "\n",
      "  He said: “Our data for the last 25 years shows that the trend is for increasing rubbish on beaches we’re surveying. Litter levels have doubled since 1993, on average. There’s the legacy issue of the rubbish that’s been discarded to date – nine of the top 10 items we record every year are plastic and plastic doesn’t disappear.\n",

      "  Lyndsey Dodds, head of marine policy at WWF, said eight million tonnes of plastic pollution enters our oceans each year, and evidence of this can be seen on Scotland’s shores at an increasing number of coastal sites.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Dodds said an EU commitment to phase out single-use plastics by 2030 – which was matched by the Scottish Government – is welcome but “that’s not to say there aren’t plenty of things to get on and do now”. She added: “The public appetite for real change is huge, in terms of single use plastics.”\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “In terms of our marine environment, a lot of that stuff could be fed into this facility,” he said. “In terms of household waste, we’re still throwing away about 70,000 tonnes of packaging that could potentially be put through the system. It’s currently costing councils about £11m a year to send it to landfill.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The system is expected to recycle around 20,000 tonnes of plastic waste a year and Gulland is hopeful that the pilot could eventually be rolled out across Scotland, meaning councils would no longer be forced to send recycling overseas for processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Local authorities currently export thousands of tonnes of plastic waste. It is difficult to find out true quantities because contracts with private sector companies are kept confidential as they are considered “commercially sensitive”, according to Gulland.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “New technology will allow us to say to householders you can put all plastics out for collection and we’ll be able to sort and recycle them in Scotland,” he said. “The Perthshire plant is designed in modular system so there is scope for increased capacity. And these types of facilities could be located throughout the country.”\n",

      "  The Scottish Government has already banned plastic microbeads and has pledged to legislate against plastic cotton buds. A fund for companies to trial technologies to recover marine waste was doubled to £1m last month. Also in the planning is a deposit-return scheme for plastic drinks containers, which would see customers pay a surcharge to be refunded when bottles are returned.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Officers do not doubt, insiders stress, the credibility and good faith of the victim and their only witness, a then 20-year-old student. She, however, does doubt them. So much so that in last week’s Herald on Sunday the woman, Caitie Mackay, waived her anonymity to express her hurt and frustration about both the crime and the way she felt it was handled by the police. Her story was powerfully told by her father, The Herald and Herald on Sunday writer-at-large Neil Mackay. Very few victims of sexual offences are able to share their perspective. Fewer still have the courage to do so under their own name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Caitie said she had identified a suspect to the police but that this man had never been interviewed. Why? Because, she was told, he would be unfit to understand the process. Last week, we suggested the man had mental health issues. In fact, we can now report, he has serious learning difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  She said the man was stalking her, turning up at her work, one of Glasgow’s biggest shopping malls. She did not feel safe. “Trying to get any form of justice or protection is pointless,” Caitie said. “I feel as if what happened to me simply does not matter. My faith in the police is destroyed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Last week, Mackay, profoundly worried about his daughter – and about the public interest issues he raised about the investigation of sex crimes – put a series of questions to the police. This week we can report how they responded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Officers spoken to by The Herald have great sympathy and respect for Mackay and his daughter. Their perspective on the investigation, is, however, in some details, is at odds with that of the Mackay family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  So much so that some of their differences may have to be resolved by a complaints process already under way thanks to formal interest from a politician following our story last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Police, specifically, say they carried out an extensive investigation in to Caitie’s complaint – which is one of public indecency rather than “a sexual assault”, as we termed the offence in a headline last week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  They also say there is “insufficient evidence” to link the man with learning difficulties to the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  And they say they have no record of any report of stalking against the man. The Mackays dispute this and are understood to be considering their own formal complaint against the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The officer in charge of investigating this case is Detective Superintendent Alwyn Bell. He leads Glasgow division’s team of public protection detectives, specialists in sex crimes. It was his unit, he explained, which took over the case shortly after Caitie reported it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Bell said: “Following a report of a man having indecently exposed himself near to Darnley train station on July 20, officers spoke to the victim and carried out a number of inquiries including a full search of the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “The inquiry was then allocated to the dedicated Public Protection Unit within the division, and following a CCTV check and other inquiries, there was no further information available at that time to identify a suspect. However, the inquiry remained open.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Bell said that efforts had been made to keep the victim updated on this investigation by phone but added that “officers were unsuccessful”. The detective, who has occupied senior public protection roles in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, also addressed – within serious legal limitations on what he can say – the concerns the Mackays had over the man identified by Caitie as her attacker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  He said: “On July 27, the victim made a further call to police reporting that she had seen the suspect within her workplace. Officers attended to speak to her and the suspect was identified by the victim as being the individual who had carried out the public indecency. “Inquiries were undertaken and, due to his behaviour, he was returned home to his parents. Officers then obtained medical advice regarding the suspect’s condition and it was made clear by a medical professional that he has significant learning difficulties, and therefore lacks the capacity to understand a police interview or the ramifications of his actions or conduct.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The man is on Police Scotland’s vulnerable persons database or VPD. He has been the subject of some inquiries. However, the force, in a formal statement to The Herald on Sunday, said they currently do not have a positive line of inquiry in the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Bell added: “The inquiry into this incident remains open and we would ask anyone who has any information which may assist, to contact us.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The story centres on some of the trickiest and most sensitive areas of police work: updating victims on live investigations and handling inquiries which touch on vulnerable people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  There can be legal, ethical and practical reasons why officers cannot share the full story of any live inquiry to complex, messy, human crimes with journalists, the relatives of adult victims and victims themselves. There can also be miscommunications and misunderstandings between police and those whose lives are affected by crime and its investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The circumstances of this case now look likely to be settled by a formal independent process of complaints.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Police Scotland has faced complaints about such issues before, including those which have been upheld and those which have not been. Each such complaint, say insiders, offers a chance to learn lessons or get to the bottom of a dispute.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The force in recent years has also increasingly secured the trust of organisations which support victims of sex crimes. Whatever the outcome of formal concerns about the Mackay case, the force will be eager to rebuild trust among victims and their families. Differing perspectives on the course of the investigation aside, insiders stress they see Caitie as a good faith witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Senior officers in recent years have put huge public emphasis on a message that they want to hear reports of sexual offences. Last financial year they recorded nearly 11,000 such crimes, more than double the historic norm. Numbers continue to rise this year, early reports suggest. In 2016-17, there were 64 cases of public indecency, the kind of offence experienced by Caitie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Somebody, police are sure, put Caitie through a terrifying ordeal on July 20. That somebody has not been caught. There have not been any reports of similar crimes in the area. However, the man who tormented Caitie may well have exposed himself to others. If you were one of those women, or have any information about who the man might be, contact Police Scotland.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Mr Leonard became Scottish Labour leader last year after defeating centrist Anas Sarwar, but he has struggled to unite his divided group of MSPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Although he won the contest comfortably, a majority of MSPs voted for Mr Sarwar and Mr Leonard has faced various challenges to his authority.\n",

      "\n",
      "  In internal selections for Holyrood, Labour members are balloted and determine which candidates get a favourable slot on each List.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Although the membership is believed to be more left-wing than it was when the 2016 List ranking process took place, allies of Mr Leonard told this newspaper that they believe bolder reforms are required to guarantee personnel changes in the MSP group.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  One possible change would be to widen the franchise for the List rankings so that trade union supporters could also vote in the internal ballot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Around 10,500 supporters from affiliated trade unions signed up to vote in last year’s leadership contest, the overwhelming majority of which backed Mr Leonard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It is believed that over 80% of the recruits were members of the Len McCluskey-led Unite union, which supports Mr Leonard and Jeremy Corbyn.\n",

      "  One party source said: “Scottish Labour must field the best possible team as we approach the next election in 2021. The status quo, where sitting MSPs are virtually guaranteed a winnable list place based on name recognition alone, can’t continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Richard Leonard must work with Labour affiliates to reach agreement on a formula which showcases the best talent in our Party and delivers a united and disciplined group. This will inevitably mean that some existing MSPs will have to make way for new faces.”\n",

      "\n",
      "  However, a source on the moderate wing of the party said: “The leadership contest descended into farce when trade union members who openly opposed Labour were given a vote. This idea is simply a tactic to ensure Len McCluskey can tighten his grip on Labour. Members will be absolutely furious if hard-working MSPs are deselected by people with no affiliation to the Labour Party and are replaced with Corbyn cultists.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Former MP Ian Davidson, who supports Mr Leonard, said Scottish Labour should not become as “sectarian as the Blairites” by embarking on a purge, but said: “The present group of Labour MSPs are unrepresentative of the Labour Party in Scotland and many have chosen not to adapt to the changed political climate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  \"Many within it [the Group] have become too engrossed in internal rows and ignore why they were selected. They, or their candidates, have lost elections. They should get over it or get out. Some should change or be changed.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "  He added: \"There needs to be a conscious effort made to widen further the pool from which candidates are drawn. Existing efforts should be continued, but even with present efforts there is too much replication of existing patterns. In particular, Labour has not managed to help sufficiently those with working class life experience and backgrounds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In a statement released earlier this month after his recent shadow cabinet reshuffle, Mr Leonard said: \"I have today asked [MP] Lesley Laird to carry out a review, reporting to me, of Scottish Labour’s organisation and operations to ensure that we are fully battle-ready for 2021.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was The Masque of the Red Death – which I now declare to be the greatest horror film ever made. It was wild, terrifying, demented. A man in a gorilla suit was burned alive by a dwarf, Death walked the Earth, nobles partied within the walls of a castle as the plague raged outside. It blew my tiny mind and scared me witless, but I kept silent, hidden behind the sofa, as I knew it was taboo and if my parents realised I was there, they’d send me to bed.\n",

A Dracula movie would be as naked without its classic location as the count without his cape.\n",

      "  A great location doesn’t have to be some gothic throwback either. Look at An America Werewolf in London – it fetishises both the English countryside and the grungy grimy London of the early 80s – or the spaceship in Alien, which becomes a white, pared-back, claustrophobic hunting ground.\n",
      "\n",

      "  In one scene we see our heroine being hunted by a killer we expect to turn into a panther at any moment. The tension builds and just when we’re sure it’s all going to end in blood and fur, a bus screeches by making viewers leap from their seats. There’s no murder, no mayhem – but it is famously the scariest part of the film. If you don’t jump at least once in a horror movie, what’s the point, most fans would say? We come to be scared.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Bad directors use music to make you jump – a screeching violin is not a scare – or cliche, like Jason Voorhees – the killer in the Friday the 13th franchise – leaping up from the dead just when we think we’re safe. Great film-makers like Lewton use your mind to make you jump, nothing else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  What a good jump scare depends on is sudden unexpected movement – tapping into that fear we have of something unexplained glimpsed from the corner of your eye. Look at the \"Sloth\" scene in Se7en: the camera lingers over a shrivelled body which police have found tied to a bed. Suddenly, the \"corpse\" moves, struggling in its bonds. The entire set-up is overturned – a body we thought was dead, isn’t.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Perhaps, the greatest jump scare is in the much underrated The Exorcist III where a satanic killer is on the loose. One two-minute scene features a static long shot of a hospital hall. A nurse is making her rounds at night – her red cardigan the only colour on screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Nothing else happens – but we know something has to happen, this is a horror movie. Just as the audience is lulled into a sense of calm, a shroud-draped man with a giant pair of medical shears – the kind used for amputations – charges at the nurse from behind.\n",

      "\n",
      "  First of all, the Monster isn’t human and that’s what’s frightening. Whether it’s the shark in Jaws, whatever the hell is in the woods in The Blair Witch Project, the house in The Haunting of Hill House, giant ants in the 1950s creature feature Them!, the xenomorph in Alien, or the demons from The Mist – these monsters are relentless. They will not stop – and we cannot fathom what drives them, beyond a desire to kill, yet they also possess a preternatural human-like intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Monsters create unanswered questions – and ignorance means fear: Why is this shark out for revenge? What is running wild in the woods? Why won’t the house stop shaking? Why are those ants the size of a Ford Focus? Why is that alien hugging my face? What are demons doing in a suburban supermarket?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Monster works on the fear of the unknown, or the ugly – fear of the non-human. The Monster plays on those deep-seated fears we experience as children – the creature under the bed at night, or something beneath your feet when you’re swimming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  THE PSYCHO\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Psycho, however, works on the opposite emotion – the fear of fellow humans, that behind our smiles and civilised cappuccinos lie salivating lunatics eager to kill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  What better place to start with the Psycho, then, than with Hitchcock’s Norman Bates. The original Psycho was based on a real murderer – a necrophile, mother-killing, grave-robbing Wisconsin weirdo called Ed Gein (who also inspired The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Quite the muse).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The roots of the Psycho always lie in reality – that’s the fear factor. Could we one day meet such killers in real life? Might we already know a Hannibal Lecter, the urbane cannibal psychiatrist with a nose for good perfume and an eye for cheap shoes; a Patrick Bateman, the boardroom American Psycho; a Jack Torrance from The Shining – the intellectual family man about to snap and kill.\n",

      "  THE THING\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  When it comes to the Thing, it’s all about the Uncanny Valley – the psychological theory that when something resembles a human being closely, but just not quite enough, it elicits a horrible feeling of dread.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Think of Nosferatu’s spindly long-fingered decaying fiend, the creature in the attic in Rec, Frankenstein’s creation bolted together from scraps of corpses, any zombie, the demonic Cenobites from Hellraiser, the baby in Eraserhead, possessed Regan in The Exorcist, even Hal from 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  I prefer to call this survivor character \"The Sally\" in homage to the female lead in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Sally Hardesty, played by 70s scream queen Marilyn Burns. Texas is loved and hated in equal measure. Horror fans hail it as the darkest and cleverest of the ultra-violent classic slasher films.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  PhDs have been written on Texas. It’s even been interpreted as a comment on Watergate – the deranged hill billy cannibal serial killers do live in a big \"white house\" after all. People who don’t watch horror films, though, detest Texas as little more that snuff-inspired torture porn.\n",

      "  Director Tobe Hooper put his Sally character through hell at the hands of Leatherface, grandpa and the rest of the slavering clan. When I first watched Texas during the 80s video nasty era, I felt physically broken afterwards – the violence, the terror, the bestial nature of what was happening on screen literally overwhelmed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But Sally survived – and because Sally survived, good won the day. Horror films often rely on such simply fairy tale tricks – make me feel scared but then offer hope that what scared me will be defeated and the result is Pavlovian, punters come back for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Sally led to Laurie Strode, the lead character in the original 1978 Halloween. Now Laurie is different to Sally. Sally does a lot of running and screaming and crying – Laurie does a lot of running and hiding and trying to breath quietly in cupboards, but then something very important happens: Laurie turns on the killer, the villain Michael Myers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In fact, at one point, we think she’s killed Myers, clad in his creepy William Shatner face mask (masks are very important in horror movies .... what lies beneath?). But, in a tradition that Halloween basically forged, the bogeyman lives to kill another day. Nevertheless, he was still vanquished, for the time being at least, by the female protagonist who remains standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Sometimes, though, The Sally doesn’t survive – a development seen increasingly in films with a strong artistic bent. In the nihilistic masterpiece Funny Games, Michael Haneke’s Pinteresque descent into hell, the end is one of deliberate despair – no-one will live, and the killers are coming for you next.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  THE SEXES\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Unsurprisingly, given that horror exploits our real fears, most villains are men. Horror movies draw very heavily on a primordial battle of the sexes theme: the brutal killer, often a mere personification of evil, versus the sparky, clever woman pushed to the limits of endurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, not all horror films conform to the genre. Some switch, and the female villain is far from unknown – but when you analyse why the woman is a killer, it’s for very different reasons to the men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Women don’t pick up chainsaws and go on mindless murder sprees – women killers tend to act out psychologically, and that can can often create the greatest of screen villains. For proof, enter Annie Wilkes from Misery, an obsessive fan with a fine line in moral rectitude (\"you dirty bird\") and a taste for torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In recent decades, more women began to pop up who should have been put in a straitjacket from birth. There’s Lola Stone in The Loved Ones – a girl you don’t want to invite to a house party; Tina, a murderous National Trust nerd, in Ben Wheatley’s black comedy of modern manners Sightseers; and Marie, the worst best friend a girl ever asked for in the French new wave horror Switchblade Romance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Carrie is probably the most nuanced female character in any horror film – she is both villain and victim. Abused by a religious maniac mother, bullied and sexually humiliated by her classmates, Sissy Spacek as Carrie becomes the revenge prototype of teen female anger.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Increasingly, we’re beginning to see men enter the role of the victim. Take the Belgian movie The Ordeal. Instead of a woman held captive by a male predator, it is a man who is imprisoned and tormented: a good way to bring home to the audience that often the gaze in horror films is on female suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  THE MEANING\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  A great horror film has to say something – an awful horror film just drips blood all over the cinema seat and leaves you as unsatisfied as a ten pound box of popcorn. By \"saying something\", I don’t mean art house pretension – I mean that a horror movie must resonate with its times.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Horror is the most mutable of genres, apart from comedy. People have fallen in love for the same reasons since time immemorial, people have sought revenge for the same reasons since time immemorial, but jokes change from one day to the next. Horror also changes, not because what scares us changes (a bogeyman will always be a bogeyman) but because for horror to work it must relate to you and the fears of the time in which you live.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  You’ll not be scared by Little Red Riding Hood, but centuries ago it terrified your ancestors. What's needed to scare modern viewers is something that echoes in our real lives – think of all those 1950s B movies riffing off the unseen menace of reds under the bed like Invasion of the Body Snatchers; or Cronenberg’s body-horror movies, like The Fly, driven by the fear of technology; there was even a spate of post-60s hippie horrors in the wake of the Manson family killings like Last House on the Left.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Probably the two best examples of horror movies tapping into modern fears come in the shape of Eden Lake, and Ils (French for Them). Eden Lake uses fear of the dispossessed to get its hooks into viewers. It makes the viewer wonder if the poor, the uneducated, the forgotten will one day rise up and kill them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  This is the horror of the housing estate. It is a brutal take on what happens when the suburban middle classes rub up against the \"underclass\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Ils – Them – is similar in tone but here it is children who are the terror. It prods at the hidden adult fear that children could quite easily kill if they wished. We’ve seen terrible crimes committed by bored, abused, forgotten children unfold in our papers and on the TV news – this film seems to say, if you beat a dog long enough it will bite you back, no matter how weak it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  I’m not trying to convince anyone that horror is art – though as a fan of horror movies, I do think the genre is capable of high art when at its very best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In a strange way, what horror can do is make you feel alive because it makes you confront death. That’s probably what I realised in my four-year-old mind back in the early 70s when Vincent Price scared the pants off me in The Masque of the Red Death.\n",

      "\n",
      "  “However, while prison staff are receiving world-leading training, prisoners themselves are not getting the skills they need. We know that giving those who have been convicted of crime the opportunity and skills to work is the best way to prevent reoffending.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Based on data covering August 2015 to July 2017, a screening programme found that 70% of prisoners were functionally illiterate, which meant they were at or below SCQF Level 4.\n",

      "\n",
      "  The same exercise found that 85% of prisoners were without a basic knowledge of maths and arithmetic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  According to the SPS annual accounts, the service spent around £4.5m on education contracts in 2017/18. With 7,461 prisoners catered for in the same year, the SPS spent around £600 per head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "  The two-year course focuses on prison and penal policy, but the service is now looking at “other ways” of boosting skills.\n",

      "\n",
      "  REMOTE communities across Scotland are sharing a multi-million-pound cash bonanza generated by the wind and rain that batters them. Over the past decade, nearly £50 million has been paid to communities from the proceeds of wind farms that have been built nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The money has been spent on a diverse range of schemes, from the renovation of village halls and bowling clubs, to taking school pupils on day trips, providing musical tuition and giving everyone in the community new Christmas lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In other cases, canny investors who have pumped savings into buying shares in community energy schemes are reaping up to eight per cent return on their investment – far more than they might hope for in any high street savings account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Such is the clamour to invest in renewable schemes, the latest share offer that calls for community investors to purchase the first of £1.89m worth of shares in six hydroelectric projects across the Highlands raised one-third of the money required within days. Indeed, demand for a share of the windfall means the offer is likely to be over-subscribed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But the real money-spinners are the lucrative community agreements made in the early stages of wind-farm planning, which has led to millions being distributed for the good of the surrounding area.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Last year alone an estimated £15.7m was distributed to community wind-farm trusts despite rising household energy bills and the £105 on average that every UK household pays to subsidise wind farms.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Funds from energy giant SSE alone – which aims to have a renewables network valued at £10 billion within five years – delivered almost £5.2m in support for community projects across the UK last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Almost all was distributed in Scotland, in many cases landing with tiny communities that are now finding themselves with so much spare cash it’s increasingly difficult to know how to spend it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Meanwhile, Scottish Power Renewables, which currently has 40 wind farms across the UK, gave over £3.5m to more than 30 community benefit funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In total, the two firms have handed out £48m to communities over the past decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  This has allowed the northerly communities of Bettyhill, Armadale, Strathnavar, Melvich and Altnahara, which sit close to the 33-turbine Strathy North Wind Farm in Sutherland, to be handed £230,000 in the past year alone, which is about £225 for each of the 904 locals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  During a 12-month spending spree, £75,000 went on a new bowling green, £25,000 for new clay pigeon traps for Armadale Gun Club, and a hefty £7,500 to bathe the handful of houses and businesses in the hamlet of Melvich – population 300 – in Christmas lights.\n",

      "\n",
      "  In Fort Augustus, the 32-turbine Bhlaraidh wind farm will deliver a £7m windfall to the community of just 3,288 people. Cash last year went on social housing and an apprentice programme, with enough left over to spend £7,500 for new windows, doors and carpets for Fort Augustus Golf Club and £6,384 for Glen Urquhart Shinty Club for a vehicle to help keep the pitch in trim.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Recent spending included £12,600 to send Golspie High School pupils on a trip to Manchester City FC, and £4,300 for a senior pupils’ common room.\n",

      "\n",
      "  “The universe is an illusion,” the goalkeeper-turned-Messiah told an unconvinced Terry Wogan during a now legendary TV interview in 1991. Icke – who preferred to be called “Son of the Godhead” at the time – had failed to ingratiate himself to the bemused host, perhaps regretfully kicking off the chat by informing Wogan that the moon was a hollow alien spaceship.\n",

      "  Although this increasingly popular theory was first mooted by Greek philosopher Plato in 400BC then sweetened for popular consumption by The Matrix, it’s Oxford academic Nick Bostrom’s recent paper supporting the concept that has lent it some heavyweight credibility.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Respected US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson gives it “better than 50-50 odds” that the simulation hypothesis is correct. “I wish I could summon a strong argument against it, but I can find none,” is his unsettling conclusion. Impish billionaire futurist Elon Musk has also mused – to a chorus of groans from Tesla shareholders – that we’re “most likely in a simulation”. It must be noted, however, that Musk was recently filmed smoking a rather large cannabis joint.\n",

Like someone firing up their Xbox for a shot of Assassin’s Creed. Our memories saved data, surroundings a hologram and bodies simply avatars, programmed to perceive a notion of forward-movement we call “time”. This serves to anchor our “thoughts” and allows us a concept of “future” for an illusionary sense of “self”.\n",

And now, we're slowly learning how to harness this ability in order to create machines of almost infinite computing power. Simply, your Mac's 0s and 1s are very slow and the timeless dimension in-between is not.

      "  Most evolutionary biologists are convinced that everything that has ever existed originates from LUCA, and a genetic portrait was recently created by evolutionary biologists at the Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf. Apparently this oddity existed in deep sea vents on the magma-drenched, celestial baby Earth and was unlike anything else that has ever existed – a spindling conglomeration of tiny cells that spent hundreds of millions of years simply chilling in the sea doing nothing. Blind, deaf yet perhaps not so dumb.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It’s notable that gender or death did not exist on Earth until LUCA unzipped itself to kick off evolution, shuffling around its genetics using some mysterious early form of osmosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Why this organism died to unleash its essential ingredients and create all life on this planet remains a deep, abiding mystery. Or perhaps LUCA was simply an alien virus in our simulation, programmed to self-destruct and seed this virtual Earth with avatars. If so, the creators of this particular illusion are playing a very long game indeed.\n",

      "  AND FINALLY …\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  EXPANDING further upon Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom’s recent Simulation Theory paper, what’s particularly striking is its casual assumption of many long-lived alien civilisations existing out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  If these beings run computer simulations – and they will, says Bostrom – then artificial realities must be abundant throughout the universe. The problem is, these alien programmers would – like us – have no idea whether they’re part of a simulation themselves. Every universe may simply be a Russian doll trapped within the darkness of another – an artifical multiverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Yet, if we are indeed living in the root level of reality, perhaps our universal common ancestor LUCA was still a computer virus of sorts – one that sacrificed its original form to set evolution in motion, hoping to gain a multi-dimentional perspective of reality through the eyes of everything that has ever lived and died on Earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  From the birds in the sky to fungus in the fields, LUCA is likely hiding in plain sight, with infinite perceptions of reality at its disposal to understand and conquer its planet completely.\n",

      "  Only last month, Sir Tony said he thought a fifth series could be made, despite the original cast having very busy schedules.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  And last year Atkinson spoke of how 20 years ago there was an idea for a series set during the Russian Revolution, called Redadder, but plans went “nowhere”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But Curtis, who went on to write blockbuster films Four Weddings And A Funeral, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Bridget Jones’s Diary, scotched chances of a Blackadder revival.\n",

      "\n",
      "  “Blackadder is a very, very complicated group of people and so if you are fond enough of the series to wish that the people involved in it should live to a ripe old age then I think it is best that we don’t work together, that’s the answer,” Curtis said.\n",

      "  “The most interesting was Bridget which didn’t work at all until we moved the penultimate scene, which was her in absolute despair in her bedroom dressed in red pyjamas drinking and crying, to the title sequence of the movie, which meant you actually felt for Bridget right from the start, which in our original cut you just didn’t.\n",

      "\n",

      "  FOR some reason that day in early 2009 made a big impression on me. Mauricio Pochettino, a hero to Espanyol fans from his playing day, had just been appointed coach of the less heralded team in the great city of Barcelona.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  I was commentating on his debut for ESPN viewers around the world. It happened to arrive in a Catalan derby against Pep Guardiola’s star ensemble who four months later were to lift the Champions League trophy at the expense of Manchester United.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Pochettino, briefly an assistant to the Espanyol women’s team to gain coaching experience, somehow guided his upstarts to a 0-0 draw in the cup. In truth, he looked as though he should still be playing himself, such was his apparent youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  A few weeks later, he went one better and beat Barca on their own patch, 2-1 in the league, ending a 27-year jinx at the Camp Nou. To this day, Pochettino doesn’t quite know how Espanyol did it. He was their third coach in that stressful season and inherited a side that looked doomed to relegation. Yet under his stewardship, he preserved their Primera status with Espanyol finishing comfortably mid table.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Since that first day, I and many others have watched with interest as the farm labourer’s son from Murphy in the north of Argentina has vaulted himself into the upper stratosphere of world football thinkers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  There has always been an admirably fierce independence about him. At Southampton he was mocked at times for initially conducting television interviews only in Spanish to be translated into English. It turned out, he had a working knowledge of English but wanted to be exact as regards his answers. It spoke a lot about the Argentinian’s attention to detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Tottenham fans know they have someone special at the helm. The football is dynamic and eye-catching with the emphasis on a demanding but brilliantly executed high pressing game. Pochettino has visibly improved younger players who tend to come through the Spurs ranks in greater volume than elsewhere in the Premier League.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The big question is, will he stay in north London for the medium or long term? On the one hand, it is tempting to remain where you are revered. This is a special season for Tottenham, with the new stadium (eventually) to be opened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But after that, a cold hard analysis of the situation might point to a desire for departure. Pochettino for all the plaudits we have bestowed on him, has not won a trophy with Spurs in his four-plus years there. Every manager is ambitious to write their name in history and it could be that at the end of this campaign, he feels the pull of another club.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Which club might that be? Real Madrid stand above all the others. In Argentina there has always been a magnetic attraction to La Liga’s big two. Plus let us remember Espanyol have something of a little brother relationship with the merengues.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Pochettino was the man Real Madrid really wanted to succeed Zinedine Zidane in the summer. Many thought it would be hard for him to reject their advances but he did, while not ruling it out in the future. A few months from now, it is reasonable to envisage a different scenario.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Manchester United will also be monitoring the situation closely as Jose Mourinho clings on by little more than his fingertips. Ed Woodward is known to be an admirer of Pochettino’s work and it is easy to visualise him occupying the United hot seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But is this an opportune time to head north? There is considerable reconstruction to be carried out, hand in hand with a sporting director. That would not worry Pochettino. More concerning might be the time required to get United back into shape.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

When Scott Brown’s long ball put Moussa Dembele behind the Rangers defence and as Wes Foderingham raced from his line, co-commentator Hugh Burns asked: “What’s the goalie daeing, Tom?” just as the Frenchman lobbed the ball home to make it 2-2 on the stroke of half time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “That interrupted my flow,” says Miller with a rueful smile. “When you look back on it, Hugh was right. But he should have throttled it back a bit to allow the passage of play to take place.

      "  “The media circus around Ronaldo is not normally a problem for Portugal’s players, because they are just so used to it,” Kundert said. “Some of the players have said that the focus on Ronaldo is actually quite helpful because it takes the pressure off of them. In the media, especially the foreign media, every single question at press conferences is about Ronaldo. There’s not too much focus on other good players who may not be performing too well, they don’t really have to face up to that or other awkward questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “In this particular case of course, and I think it is probably the reason he isn’t playing despite them not specifically saying so, is because of the allegations against him. If he was here, then the world’s media would be descending on the Portuguese camp. In this case, from the media circus point of view, then it is definitely beneficial that he isn’t here this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “The reaction has been quite varied. Overall, most people have come out in support of Ronaldo, because he is a national hero. Anywhere in the world, what do people associate with Portugal? It’s Cristiano Ronaldo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Up until this scandal, despite there being lots of people who don’t like certain aspects of his character, he has generally been a very positive role model and it has been a positive reflection on Portugal that he has achieved what he has given where he came from.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “So, it has been a bit difficult for people to try to get their head around, and a lot of people are flatly dismissing it, or labelling his accuser as a gold-digger. A lot of people just don’t want to believe it, and they think that it is people trying to take advantage of Ronaldo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “It is interesting that there is now a lot of discussion about the reaction to the news and what it tells people about the Portuguese mentality. There’s probably been more debate about that than the actual facts of the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “In the first few days after the scandal broke, it was basically blanked in the news. You have seen that to a certain extent across the wider footballing world, but perhaps in Portugal especially it has not been reported more because of who he is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  From a purely footballing perspective, any relief that under-fire Scotland boss Alex McLeish may be feeling at not having to face up to Ronaldo may be misguided.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  There is a growing theory that the Portugal side are in fact better as a whole when Ronaldo isn’t playing, a notion that seems ludicrous given his contribution to his side as recently as the World Cup this summer and his unquestionable ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Coach Fernando Santos was keen to dismiss such a theory in the aftermath of their 3-2 victory over the Poles on Thursday, stating that \"no team can be better without the best in the world”. Even so, the wins over Italy and Poland and the draw with Croatia garnered without the five-time Ballon D’or winner since Russia would seem to lend the theory at least some credence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The 4-3-3 Portugal will adopt this evening without Ronaldo seems to provide a better balance to the side than the 4-4-2 they deploy to get the best from his explosive abilities off the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Recent evidence has shown that there may be something in that, because Ronaldo was rested for the first two games after the World Cup, and Portugal actually played really well in those games,” said Kundert. “They got a win against Italy and a draw against Croatia, and they were unlucky not to win that one too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “One thing that Ronaldo not being there quite evidently does, is make the rest of the players less inhibited. They feel freer to do their own thing. When Ronaldo is there, they tend to look for him all the time. When he’s not there, they take more responsibility and on the evidence of those two games, and a few others pre-World Cup also when he sat out, they look a little bit more cohesive without Ronaldo.\n",

      "  THE years he spent playing in Scotland and England and then coaching and managing down south before he was appointed SFA performance director helped Malky Mackay to build up extensive and impressive contacts in the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  He has been able to enlist a fair few well-kent faces in his ongoing efforts to improve standards and results at every level and in every area of the Scottish game; Eric Black, Kenny Dalglish, Sean Dyche and Henrik Larsson, for example, have all answered his call of late and provided insight into their particular areas of expertise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The two day masterclasses in the art of both attacking and defending – midfield play will follow in the near future – that Mackay has put on for around 70 aspiring youth coaches at the national performance centre at Oriam proved to be enlightening and inspiring as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Eric was fabulous, Kenny was terrific and Henrik was interesting,” he said. “Somebody asked Henrik what he felt like when he moved to Barcelona and walked in the front door at their training ground on the first day. He told him: ‘I felt relief - I was relieved I didn’t have to be the main man every day’.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “He had lived with the pressure of having to be the guy who scored the goals, be the hero if you like, for seven years at Celtic. It was a great insight into the man and his thought processes. You could have heard a pin drop.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Still, Mackay is, as much as he enjoyed listening to the experiences of his fabled former team-mate, far more concerned with helping our most promising football talents to make big names for themselves at major clubs across Europe in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The strides forward he is confident are being made at every age-group level and the success of a few members of the more youthful members of the Scotland Under-21 side at the prestigious Toulon Tournament during the summer strongly suggest to him that we may not have long to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “We took Billy Gilmour of Chelsea to Toulon along with Chris Hamilton of Hearts, Mikey Johnston of Celtic, Elliott Watt of Wolves and Fraser Hornby of Everton,” he said. “We took two 16-year-olds and three 19-year-olds. We said: ‘OK, let’s see if they can handle it’.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Billy ended up being the breakthrough player of the tournament out of 220 kids. Mikey scored a fabulous goal against England in the semi-final and was named the third best player in the tournament.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “When you see the top 100 players who have played in Toulon, too, it is incredible. They are the best players in the world, Lionel Messi, Zinedine Zidane, Thierry Henry and the like. So for us to come out with the breakthrough player and third best player was unbelievable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “It is a huge benefit that tournament. It is a forerunner to an under-21 campaign and to determining if a player can kick on to men’s football. We are running to find players who can go from youth teams into first teams.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I look at Billy and see the huge potential he has and the leader he can become. Rangers did a great job with him. But he has gone to Chelsea and kicked on again. He has been promoted to their under-23 side at 17 years old He is starting to develop man’s legs and get about the pitch better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Glenn Middleton and Ross McCrorie are playing at Rangers and Mikey Johnston and Lewis Morgan have been involved with Celtic as well. It is all about having patience with these players because there is massive potential there in terms of pace and ability and guile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “There is a clarity of message with the various youth teams in the association about how we are going to be, how we are going to play and a bravery among the coaches to embrace it. When I see the results of the last 18 months I can see small wins, small steps that we have taken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Mackay feels becoming more in tune with teenage hopefuls and their ways has helped in their development. The old guard frequently blame the decline of both the national team and club game in this country on the “X-Box generation” and suspect they are more concerned with their performance on FIFA ’19 than playing in the World Cup one day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The performance director and his associates, though, have turned that love of new technology to their advantage. “How do young players learn?” he said. “Well, WhatsApp groups are the best way for young players to connect mostly nowadays. They are at ease with iPad learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “We have now got Coach Paint - it is a bit like what you would expect Jamie Carragher to be using on Sky on a Monday night. Scot Gemmill has the TV in the dressing room at half time with the Under-21s.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “We will keep fast tracking them if we feel they are ready to step up a level while bearing in mind that we have to be careful with physicality. I am, in collaboration with the clubs, going to keep pushing them when we think that they are ready to go up.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alex McLeish has certainly not been shy about promoting the best emerging talents to the senior Scotland side since being appointed manager for a second time back in February – the likes of Jack Hendry, Oli McBurnie, Scott McKenna, Lewis Morgan and John Souttar have all got game time on his watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The wisdom of doing that is being questioned by disgruntled supporters in the wake of the poor showing and disappointing defeat against Israel in a Nations League match in Haifa on Thursday evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Mackay, who himself went with an inexperienced team when he took charge for the friendly against the Netherlands at Pittodrie last year, is hopeful that supporters remain patient during this transitional period and that McLeish perseveres with his youth policy. He is sure that, in time, they are good enough to come of age at international level.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Alex has been very open,” he said. “Any time he is in, and he is in a lot, we have a cup of tea and talk. He will ask me about young players. We have got a lot coming through who are technically better and more athletic. If we can keep this group together we will start to beat mid-ranking European countries on a regular basis. That is the obstacle we have got to get over. That is the important thing here. The top teams are the top teams and that will always be the case. We saw that against Belgium.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “But then you saw us beating Hungary and Albania. Let’s get back to judging ourselves against mid-ranking European teams. If we have younger players who are technically better than they were and athletic then we have a chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “We have got to try and get to the Euros. That brings money back into the country. As well as the kudos and enjoyment of going to the finals, there is prize money that comes in and that gets distributed to clubs. It filters back down.\n",

      "  Edinburgh drew level after 20 minutes when Bill Mata's brilliant offload was matched by Grant Gilchrist who sent Simon Hickey away. Henry Pyrgos on his shoulder was held up a few metres out, but a great clear-out by Dougie Fife enabled captain Stuart McInally to pick up and drop over.\n",

With a man advantage, from a second scrum, the ball broke off Mata's boot, only for Watson to be determined offside by referee Wayne Barnes, in consultation with the video official, as he touched down.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  The 20-year-old Scot has nothing but admiration for the Australian-born England star, a player, Fagerson admits, he grew up watching. However, he doesn’t intend to be too star struck when the 20-stone wrecking ball swings in his direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I’ve never played against him or Saracens, so it will probably be one of the biggest challenges I’ve ever come up against,” says Fagerson, who in boxing parlance, is giving away a few pounds. “It’s difficult for a player to be the perfect package, but Billy does get pretty close. He’s a pretty good ball carrier and he can smack boys in defence. I’ve had quite an extensive look at him and the rest of the back row, and there are obviously ways to exploit them. Hopefully we can do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I’m only 20 and grew up watching Six Nations rugby, so I’ve obviously seen him quite a bit. It’s been pretty cool watching all the international guys, so to play against one of them will be awesome, a big challenge. I’m excited for it.”\n",
      "\n",

      "  Vunipola is only one of Saracens \"galacticos\". While still a novice at this level, Fagerson is wise enough to realise that being in awe of either Vunipola, or Kruis, Itoje, Farrell or Lozowski, could land you in serious bother. Better concentrating on his own tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “[Vunipola] is probably the best back-row I’ll have ever played against. I played against Sam Simmonds of Exeter and his footwork lit up the park, but he got exploited a couple of times up here as well so hopefully we’re able to do the same to Billy.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The received wisdom is that the influence of sports science, advanced nutritional education and the forensic attention paid to every aspect of the physical and mental fitness of players has helped to mould greater athletes with every generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Indeed, the theory that current players are fitter than before gains credence with the '60s and '70s reminisces that include fags and booze playing a starring role but for Wallace, the old-school philosophy still trumps the laptop research that is now part of daily life at every club.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “We would spend at least a couple of weeks early season building our fitness up and really work hard,” he said. “Nowadays the guideline is keeping an eye on your pulse and all of that and they keep telling me that that they are fitter but I don’t think they are as fit as we were.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “We would at least do about five or six weeks [of pre-season]. The first two weeks was to build up your stamina and toughen yourself up. We wouldn’t see a ball for maybe two or three weeks. Nowadays you can’t train without a ball. It never did us any harm.”\n",

      "\n",
      "  “I had one spell where I hadn’t scored for four or five games and I was wondering when is it going to come, the chop?” he said. “It never came until I had scored two goals in a match and then he left me out. He said if he had taken me out when you were down you might have stayed there. He just had that knack of doing it.”\n",

The team that was playing well got left alone and you played until someone got injured or he would make a change. There was a centre-half at Aberdeen and I never did very well against him so sometimes he would leave me out the side for Aberdeen at times, although over the years I had good success over Aberdeen but Jock was a master at that.

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  With the ink still barely dry on his trainer’s licence, Dukery was just Henderson’s third runner,and one of three sent to him by Ron Scott, a jeweller from Skegness, who had bought Dukery and three other horses six weeks before from Irish trainer Mick O’Toole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The day had not started well with Scott missing the race as he was dealing with the aftermath of a burglary at his shop and Henderson set off with the same nerves that still trouble him today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Dukery, ridden by Bob Davies, took the lead two out and beat All Amber by 10 lengths but Henderson still bore the look of a man just reprieved from the gallows as he admitted from the sanctuary of the winner’s enclosure: “I was a nervous wreck before the horse reached the first hurdle,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  The team of horses that Henderson trains has changed from the 22 he started with to the 50 when he was first champion in the 1980s to treble that now and he has also had to adapt to the evolution of jump racing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “The whole thing’s changed dramatically – training techniques and how we do it all,” he said. “You grow with the times because the new guys are coming in with all sorts of trendy new theories that they’ve picked up from around the world.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The one aspect of the life that never changes is the gut-wrenching moment when horses are killed on the track. Henderson found that out in 1984 when he went to the Triumph Hurdle with two fancied runners. See You Then, who had just arrived from Ireland, was the favourite but Henderson’s eyes rarely left Childown, the horse he felt could be a star. That dream died along with the horse when he broke a leg at the second hurdle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I was down with Childown and when See You Then passed me [on the second circuit] I thought he’d won,” Henderson recalled years later. “When someone said he hadn’t I couldn’t have cared less.\n",

      "\n",
      "  “It just doesn’t get any easier. You know it’s going to happen and it’s the tough part that you have to live with.”\n",

      "\n",
      "  Something else that Henderson has had to live with is still not winning a Grand National.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Six months after Dukery’s victory, Zongalero was upsides Rubstic landing over the last at Aintree but was then outstayed on the long run-in. And that is not only the closest that Henderson has got to winning the Grand National –The Tsarevich also finished runner-up in 1987 – but any of the 20 or so races bearing that name across Britain.\n",

      "  “Phew,” is probably how the players would succinctly describe it. Thereafter they have the second leg of the Champions League tie, the last league game against Spartans and a possible Scottish Cup final on November 4 to bring down the curtain on a hectic end to the season. As Scott Booth says, it's a schedule that would test a professional club, far less one packed with players who have day jobs or are in education.\n",

      "\n",
      "  If one of the latter, central defender Carly Girasoli, plays in the next three games she will bring her total to nine in just 28 days. Three of these were for the Scotland Under-17 side during their successful Euro qualifying campaign last week, so it's not as if the 16-year-old, who is still at school, has been playing in bounce games.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  While Girasoli may be an extreme example, the demands on the City players over the coming weeks will be huge. The two games against Hibs are the ones which really matter because, with all respect, nobody expects the 11-times Scottish champions to beat Barcelona over two legs.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  That is not to say City won't be straining every muscle to keep the tie alive for the return at Petershill Park on November 1. If there is any encouragement to be drawn from what looks like an unequal struggle it is that BIIK-Kazygurt, who City should have beaten in the tournament last season, pushed Barcelona all the way in the previous round and only lost 4-3 on aggregate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  That said, the Spaniards played a weakened side in the first leg in Kazakhstan and were punished with a 3-1 defeat.\n",

      "\n",
      "  ALTHOUGH it has yet to be confirmed, it looks as if Scotland could have two teams in the 2019-20 Champions League after missing out in the current season. The provisional Association ranking for next season places Scotland in 11th place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  If confirmed, this year's SWPL1 winners will qualify automatically for the last 32, while the second-place team would go into the qualifying round. That particular issue will be resolved over the next two Sundays.\n",

      "  That result denied Eddie Wolecki Black a last-four confrontation with his long-time deputy, and the man who has replaced him at Motherwell, Donald Jennow. The Lanarkshire club have had a fantastic season, winning SWPL2 at a canter, but Jennow believes Spartans are today's favourites as they have been playing better opposition week-in, week-out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It's a hard game to predict because Motherwell have a number of players who have been accustomed to winning trophies in their careers. McCulloch just hopes the grass pitch – one of the best surfaces in Scotland – can handle two games following the recent heavy rain.\n",

Tierney doesn’t want to play at right-back, so you could either have the Celtic man in his natural position in a flat back four with Robertson playing on one, or you make the call that as Robertson is probably the more accomplished left-back at this stage, so either Tierney moves to accommodate the skipper, or he drops out altogether. My preference would be for option one, but option two is still better than the current fudge.\n",

Even more concerning would be if McLeish simply judges the value of having Kevin McDonald in his team above that of some of the enforced absentees.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

He regards the court as an instrument of “colonial” domination, imposing an alien legal code on Britain. The main reason he wants to “chuck Chequers” is because Theresa May's latest Brexit plan leaves the European Court of Justice as the ultimate authority on trade disputes.

The latest backstop proposal for resolving the Irish border problem seems to involve Britain remaining in the Customs Union for an indefinite period and for Northern Ireland to remain in regulatory alignment with the European Single Market. Brussels insiders, like the Labour MEP, David Martin, of the parliament's International Trade Committee, believe a deal along these lines has already been done behind the scenes. It remains only for the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, to announce it, in great fanfare, this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But if my soundings in Brussels are correct, there is almost zero chance of it being agreed – at least by the Brexiteers. This is because, if Britain remains even partially in the single market and the Customs Union under the so called “hybrid backstop”, that leaves the UK still subject to the European Court of Justice. And these people don't mess about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The top legal adviser to the European Court, Advocate-General Eleanor Sharpston is about as tough as they get - she's a karate black-belt for a start. She made it clear that there's no bucking the ECJ. “This court decides what the single market rules are, and that isn't going to change”. Theresa May can try to claim that Britain is not under the “direct jurisdiction” of the ECJ – perhaps by having the UK Supreme Court act as intermediary – but the inescapable legal reality is that it is. The ultimate arbiter for disputes about the European Single Market and the Customs Union is the Luxembourg bench.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Boris Johnson understands this. He says that, under this week’s proposed deal: “We cannot escape the EU laws and ECJ until they allow us to – which they may never do”. He goes on to say that this makes Britain a “colony” which is of course ridiculous. There is a world of difference between a court that deals with disputes over trade and related matters, and the supreme legal authority of a nation state.\n",

      "  Whenever countries join a rules-based international trading system they agree to share sovereignty. The World Trade Organisation , the hard Brexiteers' hard backstop, also has an arbitration procedure. The European Free Trade Association, has a court. Thai doesn't mean that members of EFTA or the WTO cease to be independent countries. Perhaps the greatest mistake made by Theresa May in these entire negotiations has been to go along with the fiction that Brexit means “taking back our laws”. We never lost them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Even the UK government's own White Paper on Brexit made this clear in February 2017 when it said that the UK parliament “remained sovereign throughout our membership of the EU”. It went on to say that “it didn't always feel like that”, but the constitutional situation has never been in doubt. We never lost control of our laws, except in very narrowly defined areas. The demonising of the European Court of Justice has been a disastrous error of rhetoric, which has led many people to believe the canard that – as the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt put it at the Tory Conference in Birmingham– the EU is a “prison” like the old “Soviet Union” from which Britain is “escaping”.\n",

Try suggesting to someone from a Baltic state, like Lithuania, that the EU is prison. They'll tell you, forcefully, that it was the European Union that helped them escape from communist domination.

If Northern Ireland remains in the single market, this will be a huge attraction for firms wishing to gain the benefits of working within the EU without leaving the UK.

      "  SCOTT Wilson, who has died of leukemia aged 76, received personal praise from both the legendary writer Truman Capote, for playing one of the killers in the disturbing 1967 film of his book In Cold Blood, and from Pope John Paul II, for his performance as a 19th century Polish saint in the 1997 movie version of his play Our God’s Brother.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  A familiar character actor for half a century, Wilson reached a contemporary audience in the recurring role of the farmer and veterinarian Hershel Greene in the hit zombie drama series The Walking Dead between 2011 and 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Wilson had made only one film, playing a murder suspect in In the Heat of the Night (1967), before being cast as real-life killer Richard Hickock in In Cold Blood. Director Richard Brooks wanted unknowns to play the two petty criminals who break into a farmhouse in search of money and kill the four occupants. The killers achieved further posthumous publicity after they were executed as the subject of Capote’s famous book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Brooks stuck closely to the facts of the case and even used the actual Kansas farmhouse location, which had lain empty since the time of the murders. “Brooks wanted to create a film so unique to itself and so realistic that no-one would relate it to movie stars,” said Wilson many years later. “I think he would have been happier if he could have hanged us at the end of the film, so we couldn't talk about it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The film, which was shot in black and white with a deliberate documentary feel, was nominated for four Oscars, but was overshadowed by Bonnie and Clyde, which was much more stylised and made anti-heroes of its gangsters, played by the strikingly good-looking Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Brooks may have wanted anonymous leads – according to Wilson he refused to even mention them by name in interviews – but both Wilson and co-star Robert Blake went on to successful acting careers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Wilson’s many subsequent roles include the garage owner who kills Robert Redford in The Great Gatsby (1974), in the mistaken belief that he is having an affair with his wife, test pilot Scott Crossfield in the 1983 adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff and a victim in another real-life murder drama Monster (2003), for which Charlize Theron won the Best Actress Oscar.\n",

      "  He was born William Delano Wilson in 1942, the son of a building contractor, who died when Wilson was young.

      "  PIK Botha, who has died aged 86, was the last foreign minister of South Africa's apartheid era and a contradictory figure who staunchly defended white minority rule but eventually recognised that change was inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Internationally, Mr Botha was the most visible representative of apartheid at the height of protests and sanctions against the racist rule that ended with Nelson Mandela's election as the country's first black president in 1994.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  As such, the longtime foreign minister was vilified around the world while drawing the ire of his own boss, President PW Botha, when he said in 1986 that South Africa might one day have a black leader.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Pik Botha, who was not related to the apartheid-era president, later served as minister of mineral and energy affairs under Mr Mandela, and said in 2000 that he would join the African National Congress, the ruling party that had led the movement against white minority rule for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  He made few public comments in recent years during the scandal-marred tenure of former president Jacob Zuma, who resigned in February.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Mr Botha was absolutely delighted when Cyril Ramaphosa, a key ANC negotiator during the transition to democratic rule in the early 1990s, replaced Mr Zuma as South Africa's leader, Mr Botha's son said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Mr Botha, also a former South African ambassador to the United States, was foreign minister from 1977 until the end of apartheid in 1994.\n",
      "\n",

      "  The reduction in regional tensions was followed by the 1990 release of Mr Mandela, who had spent 27 years in apartheid prisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In 1996, Botha dropped out of active politics after leaving Mandela’s Cabinet when the National Party, the ruling party during apartheid, pulled out of South Africa’s national unity government. He has said he opposed the party’s decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  He made few public comments after that, though said in some interviews that he felt remorse and was even haunted by apartheid’s legacy while highlighting his efforts to change the system from within and oppose international communism.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In the 1996 interview with O’Malley, Botha pondered the hard choices he made as apartheid’s frontman.\n",

      "  “The other one was to say the things I did say to change people’s minds and to try and be a factor in the transformation that took place,” Botha said. “Maybe I should have resigned and maybe I should have left politics, but I hung in there.”\n",

      "  Ninety years ago this month the first cinema in the Odeon chain was opened in Brierley Hill in the Midlands, although it was originally called the Picture House. It was built by Oscar Deutsch, then 33, whose parents were Jewish immigrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Less than five years later, in 1933, there were 26 Odeons and the name had become a household word, interchangeable with cinema. By 1937 there were 250 in the chain, almost all of them purpose built and featuring art deco architecture and artefacts. The name, Odeon, was an acronym for Oscar Deutsch Entertains Our Nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The young cinema mogul died tragically young, aged just 48, of stomach cancer in 1941 (his wife later selling out to the Rank Organisation) but it was his unwitting role in helping to create the most infamous spy ring in British history that has gone untold until now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In 1934 Oscar sponsored his cousin Arnold, then living in Austria, to allow him to come to London. Arnold was a brilliant psychologist who had also studied philosophy and chemistry and who ran birth control clinics in Vienna. He was to do postgraduate work at the University of London, but this was a cover for his real work, spying for Russia, then the USSR. He was a highly-trained agent of the NKVD (haven’t times changed!), as was his wife Josefine, who was the radio operator of the team. It was Arnold who enlisted the infamous Cambridge Five, starting with Kim Philby, followed by Donald Maclean, Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess and then John Cairncross. In all, and according to later KGB records, Deutsch was to enlist and handle 20 agents in Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Cambridge Five believed that the Soviet Union was a bulwark against Nazism and fascism. They are credited, if that’s the right word, for passing on details of the Manhattan Project, the atomic bomb, to Moscow as well as countless other secrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In 1937 Josef Stalin, believing that Soviet agents abroad might be supporters of his rival Leon Trotsky, ordered Deutsch and other spies back to Moscow. Arnold wasn’t immediately executed but he was to die, the circumstances of which have never been properly established, although it seems clear he was purged along with the millions of others. It’s a tale which would make a cracking film for the present-day Odeon.\n",

      "  In what was a distasteful publicity stunt – some might also see it as an insult to abused women, Catholics and black people – and which spectacularly backfired, Paul Gascoigne was to be inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame next Sunday at a black tie dinner. Gazza is, of course, a charter member of the infamy lodge. To list all of his periods in rehab, the catalogue of racial and religious insults, his historical criminal convictions would take more space and more inclination than I can spare.\n",

      "  The Hall of Fame is organised by the Scottish Football Museum, not the SFA, and after nominations from the public an “expert panel from across the Scottish sport media” select the inductees.

      "  What should be a real honour is really all about garnering publicity and getting punters through the door of the museum, which turned over £500,000 last year. Several SFA officials had threatened to boycott the event while the country’s governing body has been at pains to say that it had nothing to do with the process of choosing who gets in. I'm sure I'm not the only one with doubts about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The museum is a charitable company which is 75 per cent owned by the SFA. In the end the Hampden blazers, faced with opprobrium and likely protest, pulled the plug. Which is good news for the woman who is being inducted on Sunday, Julie Fleeting, and who, among her garlands of honours, scored 116 goals for Scotland in 121 games.

He lost a leg in the last days of the Second World War, had a wooden one fitted, and later in life his eight-year-old son Willie fired a .22 bullet through it on a duck shoot. Just why a child was allowed to handle a gun you can make up your mind about.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Swinton was second in command of the 2nd Scots Guards Brigade when it was sent to Malaya in 1948 to put down an insurrection against British colonial rule. Malayan guerrillas had been armed by Britain to fight against the Japanese in WWII but Swinton and his soldiers were now tasked with putting down the independence movement.\n",

      "  In December 1948 the 7th Platoon of G Company surrounded a rubber plantation near Batang Kali in Selangor and the civilians were rounded up, the men and women separated. A total 24 unarmed men were then massacred by automatic weapons before the villagers' homes were set on fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Since then relatives have been lobbying for justice, calling for a full inquiry into the massacre, which was initially covered up and has been repeatedly resisted by UK governments since. In 2012 the High Court upheld a government decision not to hold a public inquiry, also ruling that there was evidence that the killings were a deliberate execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In 2015, after an appeal, the Supreme Court again ruled that the government was not obliged to hold a hearing – even although it may have been a war crime – because it happened so long ago. This month the European Court of Human Rights concurred that the appeal was inadmissible, essentially on the same grounds, bringing the last legal avenue to an end.\n",

      "  A CURIOUS dissonance is evident in the reaction of some conservatives to ideas of reparative justice. This concept was at the heart of Glasgow University’s research, published recently, into its historical associations with racial slavery. The report, Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow, acknowledged that in today’s money it benefited from up to £200m worth of gifts and bequests derived directly and indirectly from slavery. It was produced after a year-long period of research conducted by Professor Simon Newman and Dr Stephen Mullen and stands as a remarkable work of scholarship in its own right. It doesn’t spare any of their former alumni and those grand men of 18th and 19th century Scotland, including one of its own principals, whose fortunes and influence were gained as a result of their participation in this trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The report contains excruciating and heart-breaking details of the evil that human beings are capable of visiting on their fellow men and women. Any pleas in mitigation of the kind that black people were deemed to be fair game in a more barbaric and uncivilised world fall in the face of the many who knew, even then, that this was a vile trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Last week, Professor Sir Tom Devine, Scotland’s foremost historian, published his long-awaited history of the Clearances that transformed the economic, cultural and physical landscape of Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Scottish Clearances (A history of the Dispossessed 1600-1900) bears witness to an evil closer to home in which multitudes of the poorest people in Scotland were forced – often brutally and without mercy – from the land that had sustained their families for centuries. The title alone has sparked controversy as it immediately challenges the long-held shibboleth that the Highlands and Islands bore an overwhelming majority of the forced clearances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In the opening sentence of his introduction to this work Professor Devine writes: “I have thought, written and taught on several of the issues in this book for nearly 40 years. But this is the first time I have tried to bring all the parts of a fascinating historical jigsaw into a single framework.” In the opinion of others it is his magnum opus. It also provides a final and exquisite stitching underpinning the tapestry woven through three of his other great Scottish histories: To the Ends of the Earth, Scotland’s Empire and Independence or Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Throughout his latest work Professor Devine challenges an assortment of other questionable narratives including the one that holds that the mass of depopulation in the Highlands was caused by the Clearances (only around a quarter of it was) and that it was mainly English landlordism and English factors who were responsible. None of this of course diminishes the full extent of the inhumanity and human greed that laid waste to entire communities across Scotland; if anything it amplifies them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The concept of reparative justice, if applied to the Scottish Clearances, would be howled down by those families and institutions which benefited most from the greed and exploitation of their ancestors: “It was too long ago,”; “what’s to be gained”, “it only feeds a culture of grievance”. You hear similar sentiments espoused by the landowners’ organisations which represent the 500 individuals who own more than half of Scotland. That many of them benefited from illegal land grabs in an era of political, religious and judicial chaos seems never to have given them any cause to reflect on this let alone make amends. In any case, they aver, they are better stewards of the land and few but them know how to thrive in these wild places. They weren’t always wild though, and entire communities once lived in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The University of Glasgow has pledged to initiate a lengthy and sensitive journey of amendment not simply to acknowledge its slavery past but also “to engage in the kinds of reparative justice most appropriate to a university based on Enlightenment ideals of truth and justice”. This will include establishing deeper links with the University of the West Indies and funding exchange programmes and scholarships with communities throughout the Caribbean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The university was just one of many Scottish institutions which benefited from the proceeds of human wickedness and greed. How many banks, insurance companies, shipping firms, private schools and grand Scottish mansions – and the families who live in them – were also enriched because their ancestors treated black people worse than animals? If, in two years’ time none have felt the need to follow a similar course to that taken by the University of Glasgow then Scotland’s claims to be a country where truth, justice and enlightened attitudes thrive will have been eroded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  When injustice and inhumanity is permitted to occur on a grand scale only a small and powerful elite benefit. If they’d had to share the proceeds of their dishonesty and cruelty they wouldn’t have bothered. This is why their descendants and the political causes they support are the loudest in protesting that any moves to denude them of some of the wealth they inherited from the reset of stolen goods. Yet no-one’s asking them to pay it all back: nothing remotely like it. All that we’d ask of them is that they undertake the same self-examination as the University of Glasgow and perhaps fund some social programmes for those who suffered most from their families’ dishonesty and brutality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  And if they refuse to do this voluntarily then perhaps an enlightened, liberal and socially progressive government like, oh, I don’t know ... like our SNP Government, could ensure that it happened anyway. A first step would be to establish a Justice Commission which would name and shame the modern-day beneficiaries of theft, murder and illegal land-grabs both here and in those countries where our ancestors caused so much suffering. An index of those families and institutions which were built on slavery and which have refused to acknowledge this must be established and published. Customers could then decide if they wanted to favour such institutions with their business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Another way, of course, would be simply to ensure that a preferential option for the descendants of those worst affected in Scotland underpinned our Government’s social policies. That is, of course, if we want a sense of fairness to guide the way Scotland conducts its business.\n",

      "  IT’S hard to sit down for a serious discussion with anyone these days and not mention Donald Trump. With Karine Polwart for company such an omission would be verging on the indecent, and when we meet on a breezy morning in the cafe of Edinburgh’s Summerhall arts complex I’ve no intention of causing offence. So Trump is high on the list of questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It would be too strong to say he’s like musical catnip for the 47-year-old singer-songwriter. She’s not obsessed. But he has been, and continues to be, a strong if unlikely presence in her work. It’s as if the pair are in some strange state of quantum entanglement, him in the White House, her in the Midlothian village of Pathhead where she lives with her two young children.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Trump first came into her orbit and was first skewered by her in song when he was just a golf-loving, sand dune-demolishing millionaire. Cover Your Eyes was inspired by You’ve Been Trumped, Antony Baxter’s award-winning 2011 documentary about Trump’s controversial golf complex in Aberdeenshire and was written to be performed at a special screening of the film in Edinburgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Then on January 19, 2017 Polwart found herself opening Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival in the company of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Once again, the stars seem to have aligned because the next day Trump was due to be inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States. What else could she do but play Cover Your Eyes, its oblique accusation of venality and hubris given new weight by the political events unfolding across the Atlantic?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Now, as the second anniversary of Trump’s election win rolls round she enters the lists for a third tilt at him in a song titled I Burn But I Am Not Consumed, taken from new album Laws Of Motion. The song title, as you probably don’t know, is the clan motto of the MacLeods, whose number included Donald Trump’s late mother, Lewis-born Mary Anne MacLeod. A mixture of music and spoken word it sends another sly broadside Trump-wards. Not that he’s likely to notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I didn’t set out to choose him [as a subject],” Polwart says, between sips of tea. “I guess it’s because of the ancestral link to Scotland and because he has had such a presence in Scotland and been such a political spark … I’m not writing about him in his capacity as a Washington play-maker. It’s all about what he is here, how he interacts with where I live. I think that’s part of why I can’t take my eyes off him. It seems like he’s one of the most globally influential people on the planet and yet he’s been mucking around in my back yard.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  In fact, Polwart mentions Trump before I have a chance to, in the context of another song from Laws Of Motion. Titled Cassiopeia, it’s written from the point of view of her nine-year-old self and deals with the spectre of nuclear war. In it she imagines the four-minute warning sounding over Grangemouth and how she plans to seek shelter in the family jam cupboard. Her own children are now around the same age, so I ask her what in their 21st century lives carries the same level of threat and causes the same sort of nagging worry as nuclear war did to her (and me) in the 1970s and 1980s.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I think it’s still nuclear armageddon, to some extent,” she replies. “It’s not quite as omnipresent as it was but it’s coming back, so I think they’re aware of that. I think also Trump as a figurehead for … something. He’s one of the few political characters that they’re aware of in their everyday chat in the playground.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  As well as Trump and his nukes she also lists the refugee crisis, emerging fascism, climate change and the environment, in particular the over-use of plastics as subjects her children are aware of and concerned about. But though her kitchen table is a place for “really frank discussions” about those and other topics, she’s aware that her duty as a parent is to comfort and coddle as well as to educate. And certainly not to terrify.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I think we’re headed for much worse times than we’re in, but I’m not going to tell my children that. It feels important that there’s not blinkers over their eyes. But on a day-to-day, getting-through-your-life basis you can’t do that. That’s not a way to raise your kids, to be fearful.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Ultimately, she says, her role is to be “militant about kindness and about awareness of other people’s experiences. Those are my only tools against what’s happening.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  As it is round her kitchen table, so it is in her songs. Polwart is a serious musician who tackles serious subjects through the prism of other people’s experiences. She’s a self-confessed pessimist but one who hasn’t lost that all-important capacity for joy and she has an apparently boundless enthusiasm for stories. In her live shows she loves to tell them – case in point, her acclaimed 2016 Edinburgh International Festival (EIF) show Wind Resistance, performed at the Lyceum Theatre – and off stage she loves to hear them or uncover them, especially if they concern the lives of Scottish women or “some backwater place that speaks to some bigger issue”. It’s what she refers to as “hidden history sort of stuff”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “That’s one of my furrows. I’m really interested in songs that have a very specific local connection. In this respect I’ve been inspired by people like Michael Marra, who always spoke in a very place-based voice but wrote about everything through the lens of Dundee. To me that’s beautiful. Those songs are universally resonant, partly because of the particularity of the details.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  There’s a fine example of this on Laws Of Motion in a song called Matsuo’s Welcome To Muckhart, picked up from a working visit Polwart made to Muckhart Primary School in Clackmannanshire in the company of fellow musician (and Pathhead neighbour) Martin Green, of folk supergroup Lau. There she learned about Shinzaburo Matsuo, a skilled gardener who left Japan after losing his family in the devastating earthquake of 1923 to live and work at Cowden Castle which was owned then by Scottish adventurer and travel writer Isabella Christie. “That’s a bonkers story. There’s a grave in the kirkyard at Muckhart that just says Matsuo. It’s incredible that they had this expert Japanese gardener just ferried across the world to tend this garden.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Elsewhere on the new album Polwart reveals her wider concerns. The Suitcase is concocted out of stories collected by Green and deals with the life-saving Kindertransport which brought some 10,000 mainly Jewish children to refuge in the UK in the 10 months between Kristallnacht and the outbreak of the second world war in September 1939. On a similar theme, the title track tackles the global refugee crisis and points an accusing finger at those who would “build walls” to “defy” the movement of people fleeing war or poverty or ecological disaster. So yes, there’s another digit aimed at Donald J Trump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Although both her siblings are musicians – brother Steven is a member of her trio, along with Martin Green’s wife Inge Thomson – Polwart didn’t spend her childhood immersed in folk music or surrounded by instruments. In fact, her first foray into singing came through membership of local choirs and as part of The Banknock Kids, a pop band organised by a music teacher and a taxi driver in the Stirlingshire village in which she grew up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The band played in care homes, community halls and hospitals and for a four-year period in her early teens it was a large part of her life. But when she left school and enrolled at the University of Dundee to read philosophy it was politics that occupied her. Music “got squished out of me,” she says, “for about 10 years”. It was replaced by a strong sense of political engagement which, on graduation, took her to work for Scottish Women’s Aid. She started out as a play scheme worker in Dundee. It proved to be an eye-opening experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “I remember very clearly visiting a family in one of the outlying schemes and there was a mother and six or seven kids sleeping in one room on mattresses. This was in the early 1990s. I just couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t fathom it. It was so far removed from my own experience and it was properly shocking. And enraging. I thought ‘How is this even possible?’”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Later she moved to Glasgow to work with children in refuges in the city before moving into the area of policy. And, as ever, she heard stories: of violence and fear but also of courage and indefatigability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “That was really inspiring,” she says. “A lot of those women had a lot of knowledge and experience and a way of being in the world that was quite magnetic. There was weight behind them. They were just resilient and very, very hardy characters. And I guess that was sort of my entry into feminist analysis of the world and the context of patriarchy and all the rest of it. That was, and continues to be, a big influence.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It wasn’t until the early Noughties that Polwart returned to music, as a singer with folk act The Battlefield Band and in 2003 she released her first solo album, Faultlines, named Best Album at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. Two more albums of original compositions followed – Scribbled In Chalk in 2006 and This Earthly Spell in 2008 – as well as an album of traditional folk songs, 2007’s Fairest Floo’er.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Then, in 2012, came Traces, arguably her breakthrough album and the one featuring Cover Your Eyes as well as King Of Birds, another live favourite and a song written about the Occupy London protests. Traces was shortlisted for the Scots Trad Music Awards but, crucially, it also made the shortlist for the 2013 Scottish Album of the Year Awards, where it lined up against records by leftfield rock acts Django Django and Twilight Sad, Paul Buchanan of Blue Nile fame and Scottish rappers Stanley Odd. A Pocket Of Wind Resistance, the album version of her EIF stage show, was similarly honoured at this year’s awards, which was won by Edinburgh’s Young Fathers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  As music came back to the fore, politics remained a force in her life and it found expression in more than just her lyrics. She is a long-standing member of the Green Party – at one time she headed up the Midlothian branch – and was active and highly visible in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, campaigning on the Yes side. In that cause, she was ultimately disappointed of course. In fact, she admits, “it took the stuffing out of me”. But it left a very definite artistic legacy thanks to the way it brought creatives from all disciplines together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “You were literally in the same room as people who did all kinds of different things, who you might never have met, and you ended up having interesting conversations,” she says. “There were events happening all over the place which brought together poets, musicians, animators. All that stuff has meant that by happenstance a lot of people have met each other who might not have done.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Polwart can point explicitly to projects she has undertaken since 2014 which wouldn’t have happened had those connections not been made in the run-up to the referendum. Two she names are Pilgrimer, a collaboration with the novelist James Robertson and a Scots re-working of (and homage to) Joni Mitchell’s 1976 album Hejira, and Wind Resistance itself, commissioned by the playwright David Greig. And it’s from doing Wind Resistance, a personal meditation on the flora, fauna, human histories and natural geography of her Midlothian home, that Polwart has now found herself being courted by new audiences – everyone from ornithologists to indie kids – and venues. Next month she plays London’s prestigious Cadogan Hall.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Wind Resistance was a tipping point,” she says. “So many came who had no idea who I was. They came because they trusted the Edinburgh International Festival or the Lyceum or they were intrigued by the concept. So I feel like this whole world of possibilities opened up and it means that as a result the kind of things I’m being asked to do moving forward are wholly different from before.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Among those “things” are a song cycle for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, a collaboration with composer Pippa Murphy, and a children’s book, A Wee Bird Was Watching, illustrated by Edinburgh-based artist Kate Leiper and published next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But if some things change in scale and focus, others stay exactly the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “My motivation for ever getting involved in music or making anything is about social contact,” says Polwart. “That was the reason I joined a choir, joined a class, wanted to go to a session and sing a song. It wasn’t about performing – it was about being in a room, with people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  And where there are people there are stories – to hear, to share and to tell. Especially to tell.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It might sound counterintuitive, but much of the reason for this was the show’s utter lack of a sense of humour. Not every drama has to verge on comedy to succeed, of course, but a core of wry humour runs through all the greatest dramatic writing, from Shakespeare to Samuel Beckett to The Sopranos. One of the best series on TV at the moment, Black Earth Rising, deals in serious, profoundly horrific stuff, but a sharp, odd, absurd, gallows tone flickers constantly, like a candle in the dark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Informer, a six-part series written by Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani, illustrates the point perfectly. A thriller that deals in the same topical, potentially controversial subject matter as Bodyguard – a counterterrorism police unit, and the grey areas they enter and dubious tactics they employ – it’s a serious and considered piece of work. Yet the dialogue is written and performed with a deftness and lightness of touch that makes the whole thing come alive and breathe.\n",

      "  We meet him on his home patch, east London, a smart young guy going about his day: working; flat hunting; picking up his kid brother from school; getting ready for a night out. These early minutes flow effortlessly, yet have more texture and pointed attitude than many entire series, touching on everything from the gentrification of the city, to unconscious racism, to the way Raza cannily uses stereotyping as a tool. (Amid a welter of great details is the way he customises his brother’s school blazer as a suit jacket for his night out.) Unfortunately for Raza, his clubbing ends in police cells, arrested for possession. Here, by unfortunate coincidence, he falls under the gaze of Gabe (the magnificent Paddy Considine, on quite tremendous form), a counterterror cop looking to “recruit” – ie, coerce – a new British-Pakistani informer to help track rumours of an Islamist cell possibly plotting a bombing. Meanwhile, we catch glimpses of Gabe’s own experiences undercover among a right wing group, and the effect it has had on him. Constantly wrong footing, always believable, packed with incident, hard-eged and written for a reason, it’s a fantastic opening.\n",

The script flashes back and forth across a decade, from the present, to when the couple first grew concerned about how their baby was developing. Based on comedy writer Shaun Pye’s own experiences, it’s sitcom on top, but candid and sometimes almost painfully tender beneath the skin.\n",

Nevertheless, she presses on, searching for the old case file her mother compiled, then heading toward the heart of the case, and of her own history, by journeying to Rwanda for the first time since she was an infant. Tonight’s episode comes bookended by two scenes that are ominous for entirely different reasons, and manages to fit in an action-movie scuffle and chase in the middle, spiced with some very odd touches. Yet what really marks this stunning thing out is the steady pull of its intelligence, and how it credits viewers with intelligence, too. The complex plot about the Rwandan genocide offers a lesson in recent history, but this is also a lesson in drama. Few series have so heroically disregarded focus-group thinking about what audiences will sit still for.\n",

Travelling the country, exploring some of the reasons for the recent explosion in homelessness, and explaining how and why the real numbers are much higher than officially recorded, rapper Professor Green is a candid presenter – his own shock and despair is often plain to see. At the heart of the film is Luke, then 20, who had already been living rough in Manchester five years. Using the then-still-legal spice as a way to blot out his situation, he was caught in an ever-downward spiral.\n",

Made with astonishing access to couples who learned during pregnancy that their unborn children might be at risk, the documentary considers some of the medical aspects of such cases. But it’s the parents themselves who make it, including Vicki and her partner Bruce, whose story is followed over several months. “She’s still our baby,” she says, as she holds her newborn, stillborn daughter, Ruby, immediately after delivery.\n",

Although it unfolds with the grip of a gritty thriller, this short, sharp series is a retelling of one of the most infamous crimes in postwar Germany. In 1988, two armed men staged a bank job that went wrong, and then went on the run across West Germany with their hostages. As police made one mistake after another, and a media circus joined in on the chase, a small crime soon spiralled into a black, tragic fiasco that altered the course of policing (and reporting) in Germany.

Built in the early years of last century, it was a working school right up until the 1970s, and, for many older adults, it’s a step right back into their school days. But, for the kids, it’s a step into a world of magic. So if your children are potty about Potter, their free Wizard School, running from Tuesday to Friday this week, is just the ticket.

They didn’t just stop at hill-walking, though, soon they were doing boot camps, indoor climbing, badminton, Tough Mudder, and other pursuits. This holiday, they hit on the idea of using the draw of the video game Fortnite to lure families out for actual physical activity. Thus their Fortnite Laser Quest was created.

People looking on said, “O Margaret, will ye say it?” She said, “Lord, give him repentance, forgiveness, and salvation, if it be Thy holy will.” Lagg cry’d, “Damn’d bitch, we do not want such prayers; tender the oaths to her.” She said, “No, no sinful oaths for me.” They said, “To hell with them, to hell with them, it is o’er good for them.” Thus suffered they that extraordinary and unheard-of-death.\n",

As we needed only take one pack horse with a tent and food for three days we thought we could make the journey without help. We were told that there were fires on the road when we started. My husband thought the fires might not be bad though the air was full of smoke. When we made the ‘Nine Miles’ it grew unpleasantly thick. As we neared Powder Camp we found the trees were blazing on both sides of us. My husband handed me the baby to carry and went on leading the pack horse.

So we parted.\n",

The whole forest seemed to be on fire [and] the heat was almost unbearable. The smoke was suffocating and we kept a blanket wrapped around little Edgar’s basket. To add to our misery a huge cedar crashed across the trail.

Then they came thick and fast all round us – it was a terrible feeling, watching where the next would come. We drove for our lives along a road which was turned into pandemonium – horses and men flying, hay carts overturned, horses lying dead. We picked up one man and took him with us – he had nine holes in his back. The enemy was just over us all the time – quite awful. Bell was wonderful. She pacified the frightened men, told them to lie down, held terrified horses, and kept us all from feeling upset. I was not really afraid, but I just wanted to get back to William [her brother]. I felt I didn’t want to be killed, and it was just as likely to be me as anyone here. However, we got back to the hospital with the wounded man, and for the moment the enemy has gone off. But at lunch time they came back in double the number, and shelled the town afresh. They hovered over our camp for over an hour; then at tea time they were back again – guns firing and shells flying through the air... For the moment we are all safe, but how long will it last?\n",

That memory is not one on which I want to dwell too much in any case, because the whole experience was very frightening. The problem started following a speech I made at the Bannockburn Rally when I said the enemies of Scotland were not the English but ‘Scots traitors within the gate’. This infuriated some Labour MPs who took the remark personally, though why they should I don’t know, unless they had a guilty conscience. One of them seemed to become unhinged by it. I first noticed the problem in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs. Wherever I sat this MP sat opposite. If I changed seats, he did so also. Then I noticed that he had started to follow me along corridors, appearing behind me without saying anything. It got so bad that on one occasion I stopped dead in the corridor as an old Tory, Boyd Carpenter, went past and complained to him that this man – pointing behind me – was following me everywhere.

      "  The newly-baked tart that’s cooling off in the window of Edinburgh’s Little Chartroom fills me with optimism about good things to come. It has a straight-from-the-oven, home baked quality, only it looks that little bit more prefect than most domestic efforts. Is there only one, I wonder, might it run out?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  That this faint anxiety even crosses my mind at this premature stage reflects the smallness and intimacy of this beautifully curated restaurant, no bash-it-out assembly line this, more like a scaled-up dinner for friends, where the cook, arms brimming from the market, cooks the pick of the day. In fact they’re so serious about seasonality here that the printed menu risks constant updating- only one portion of this, only two of that- and when it’s gone it’s gone. I love this philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The place itself, welcoming, but smartly sparse as befits the limits of the space, shows similar coherence, decorated in a classic Breton colour scheme: creamy painted brick walls, French navy bar, dark wood. Wise focus shapes this menu: three choices each of starters and main courses, two desserts or cheese. The simplicity of the Little Chartroom is soothing. Both its physical calmness and the ease of choosing quietly combine to foster contentment, a feeling that in you’re in capable hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  And all my expectations are met on the plate. The menu here doesn’t drone on nor is it pretentiously cryptic. It just accurately describes what’s on offer, although as I cut into the chicken, wood pigeon and prune terrine, it’s obvious that they’ve undersold it. What a clever dish this is. Somehow or other the white chicken meat isn’t dry, the pigeon has remained pink and juicy yet offers no resistance in the mouth, even though they’re both encased in a luscious, but firmly cooked pork forcemeat bound with streaky bacon. How does the chef manage to cook each meat to perfection then wrap them up one accomplished dish? Ribbons of carrot, angular radish, beetroot, quartered florets of romanesco, all crunchy, lightly pickled, make a brightly vivacious foil for the sturdy terrine. Celeriac soup? Don’t yawn. This one is something else. Its velvety folds dispatch a whiff of potent stock: goose or duck maybe? It’s capped with cubes of fried celeriac, translucent celery, broken walnuts and green apple matchsticks. There’s a hugely satisfying warm crumpet with it, dense yet springy, not unlike a handmade potato scone, and it’s dusted with curls of soft creamy, grated walnut.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Some swine got to the mushroom and leek Pithivier before us – drat! – but game replaces it. Venison, partridge, grouse? We choose the latter, once again impeccably timed so that the leg and breast are each soft and succulent in different ways. The unique autumn woods flavour of the bird finds echoes and balance in bitter chicory cooked to collapse, roasted crescents of apricots, and less commonly encountered, fragrant wild mushrooms: orange birch boletus, saffron milk cap. Then there’s the hake, seconds overcooked for my taste. No matter, I’m seduced by its fennel roasted to amber, the grilled half moons of charred cucumber (or perhaps it’s marrow) and the sauce, which is somewhere between a seafood bisque and a butter emulsion, with a tiny dice of orange segments dotted around it, freshening up the chunky fish.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Phew, that tart- it’s bramble and lemon- hasn’t yet been eaten, and tastes every bit as good as it looks. It needs no embellishing but I’m not turning my nose up at its white chocolate ice cream, the buttery almond crumble it’s sitting on, its tart bramble purée, or its two dinky bramble macaroons. Carrot cake is the other dessert. Boring? Not this one. An adroitly moist sponge, hauntingly scented- with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, star anise maybe?- provides the body, squiggles on top of it taste like fresh white cheese, not overly sweetened, with a slightly floral, marzipan note that might come from meadowsweet. A quenelle of carrot ice cream hangs off it at a rakish angle. Its custardy consistency reminds me pumpkin pie, its taste of Indian halwa.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  JAVIER Marias, a man of many opinions, once said that novelists “can only fully tell stories about what has never happened, the invented and imagined.” Whether or not you agree, in his latest novel, Berta Isla, in which his eponymous central character is the wife of a spy, Marias takes this idea as far as possible. Though not directly connected to his masterly trilogy, Your Face Tomorrow, this new work by one of Spain’s foremost writers, shares many of the themes and locations in those books.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Set between Madrid and Oxford, it is the account, spanning 30 odd years, of a couple’s relationship, and the terrible strain put upon it by the husband’s murky profession. If fiction can only deal in the imagined, then a spy is a gift of a subject. Since someone like Tomas can never reveal what he is doing, his wife is consigned to months and years of fruitless speculation. She lives in limbo and yet, because she loves him, she copes: “She had discovered how boring it was to live with absolute certainty and how it condemned you to just a single existence, or to experiencing the real and the imaginary as one and the same”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Tomas, for his part, becomes a secret agent with foreboding: “I will be who I am not, I will be a fiction, a spectre who comes and goes and departs and returns.” Like Berta he was brought up in Madrid. He is also bilingual because of his English father, so while Berta goes to university in Madrid, he studies at Oxford. They plan to marry when they graduate but while apart form brief attachments to others. This proves to be Tomas’s undoing. A brilliant mimic, he is approached to join the secret services by a professor rumoured to have been an agent in the war. Tomas rejects the idea immediately. But when his English girlfriend is found murdered, and he is the main suspect, only shadowy figures from the foreign office can save him from arrest. In return, he must pledge himself to the “defence of the Realm”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  References to fiction and poetry recur in this elegant, discursive, persuasively vivid novel. Marias knows that espionage depends on lies and weasely versions of the truth; that sometimes the false stories used to bait the enemy are as important as James Bond heroics. George Smiley is perhaps a better model for the twilight realm in which Marias’s characters live, and at one point, inevitably, John le Carre is name-checked. A young policeman called Morse also makes an appearance, investigating the death of Tomas’s lover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Marias often places real figures in his fiction, so to steal from a novelist is no great leap. Morse is a jarring note, though, too playful for the sombre subject in hand. Because for Tomas, joining the secret service ruins his and his wife’s lives. As the years pass, each records their predicament, a duet that grows increasingly bitter and resigned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  One of several memorable set pieces revolves around an argument in which Berta demands to know Tomas’s view of Shakespeare’s Henry V. She is preoccupied by the scene where, the night before battle, the king in disguise hears himself criticised by one of his troops. Should he punish the soldier, or would that be treachery of another kind?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It is a brilliant few pages, the couple’s heated debate ranging widely over the same ethical minefield they must navigate if Berta’s trust in her husband is to be upheld. She, for instance, does not like to think of the ways in which he must trick people into revealing secrets. Tomas, meanwhile, maintains that, unlike Henry V, “you don’t lay traps for the faithful”. This extended passage is the crux of the novel, the point at which this formerly tender couple realise what Tomas has become, and what Berta must choose to accept or not. What they cannot foresee is that worse is to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The novel’s literary underpinnings serve not as distraction but as the scaffold around which it is constructed. Repeatedly Tomas quotes lines from TS Eliot, first read on the fateful day he turns spy. They are to prove prophetic: “And any action is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea’s throat, or to an illegible stone.” As Marias reminds us, we fool ourselves if we think we are in control of our fate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  As always, plot is secondary to the scenario Marias explores. In this he is a philosopher, like his father, endlessly deliberating moral quandaries. He knows that the surface hides much of what really matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  This is an enthralling work, but not everything is as seamless or satisfying as in some of his other novels. When the structure of the book becomes clear, the narrative duet undermines its tension. And there is a downbeat tone, a detached air, that overwhelms any sense of propulsion. Just once is there high drama – superbly executed – when Berta’s baby is mortally threatened by Tomas’s enemies. The reverberations of that roll down the years, but for the most part the novel takes place in its characters’ heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Marias is nevertheless clever in deploying a bloodless tone for a most disturbing subject. The result is powerful and indelible. What begins as a love story turns into tragedy of a peculiarly cruel nature. It is bearable, even enjoyable, only because he spares us all the details, and focusses on the essentials.\n",

      "  So it looks as if the UK Government’s “efforts” so far on the Brexit front are providing businesses with no reassurance that the damaging effects of leaving the EU will be mitigated. In short, it seems finance chiefs are not at all confident Mrs May and her Government will be able to fashion some kind of effective parachute to reduce the pain of the landing.\n",

      "  Talk has swirled in recent days about a deal being nearer again but this has been accompanied by seeming foot-stamping from the Democratic Unionist Party, which is providing the prop to the deeply divided Conservative Government.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Weak demand in the UK, the second-top risk, is certainly not unconnected to Brexit. After all, the vote to leave the EU sent sterling plunging and inflation surging, which led to a renewed fall in real-terms pay for a long period. And real-terms household earnings remain under pressure, with employers’ Brexit worries making them even more reluctant than normal when it comes to awarding healthy pay rises.\n",

All of this, surely, does not bode well for UK economic growth.\n",

      "  What is perhaps a little surprising is the absolute bloody-mindedness of arch-Brexiters in continuing to insist that we should carry on regardless into deeper economic gloom, even as evidence of reality piles up.

      "  ALARM bells over Johnston Press’s future started ringing in May 2015 when, after announcing a major debt restructuring and rights issue, the firm’s share price – which had topped £59 in 2004 - plunged from £1.30 to less than 20p.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  And, yes, issuing £220m worth of bonds with a June 2019 expiry got the business out of having to pay back millions of pounds by the end of 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But with the company taking those decisions at a time when its revenues were falling and its pension deficit was rising, it was simply kicking the issue down the road – and the market knew it.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Now, with June 2019 looming large, there is no road left and, having tried and failed to either refinance its bonds or come up with a solution for dealing with its £40m pension deficit, the business has put itself up for sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The problem is that the company’s shares never recovered from their 2014 rout and, having bumped around the 3p mark for most of the past year, their current price gives Johnston Press a valuation of just £3.4m.\n",
      "\n",

      "  The latest state of the energy market report from Ofgem found ScottishPower, SSE, EDF, British Gas, npower and E.On lost 1.4 million customers in total in the year to June. They saw their combined market share fall by around five percentage points.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, Ofgem said 54 per cent of households were still on a poor value default deal rather than a fixed price contract in April compared to 57% in October last year.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It said the proposed merger of SSE’s retail business with npower will result in the UK market becoming more concentrated.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Ofgem said competition works better in the non-domestic market, but the UK’s small and micro businesses pay much more on average for their energy than larger firms.\n",
