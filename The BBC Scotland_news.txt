Dundee Michelin factory workers have spoken of their shock after the company announced its intention to close the plant, with the loss of all 845 jobs.  The tyre factory will close by mid-2020 after the French firm deemed it "unsuitable" in the current climate. Scotland's economy secretary Derek Mackay said he will convene an action group to "explore all options to secure a sustainable future for the site." Workers were sent home until Thursday following a meeting at the factory. Some employees told BBC Scotland they were angry that they first learned about the decision from the media on Monday.

Celtic FC has been criticised for its failure to comment on the conviction of paedophile Jim Torbett. The Celtic Boys Club founder was jailed for six years on Monday after being found guilty of sexually abusing three boys over an eight-year period. But more than 24 hours after the trial concluded Celtic FC has not responded. The football club told the BBC last year the Boys Club was a "separate and distinct" organisation. However decades of Celtic View magazines, and never before seen footage obtained by BBC Scotland, shows how the two clubs were intertwined.

Emmy, who requires the use of a wheelchair for anything further than a short walk, has vagoglossopharyngeal neuralgia - a rare neurological condition.

The mother of Mike Towell has told an inquiry his life could have been saved if he had been given a brain scan in the weeks before his death.  The boxer went to Ninewells Hospital in Dundee complaining of severe head pains a fortnight before he collapsed in the ring in September 2016. Also giving evidence, Mike's girlfriend told a fatal accident inquiry that he was treated for a migraine on that occasion. She said he suffered a seizure in May. The 25-year-old fighter from Dundee collapsed in the ring in Glasgow, after losing a bout in the fifth round to Welshman Dale Evans on 29 September 2016.

Tram workers in Edinburgh are being balloted on industrial action. Services over the Christmas and New Year period could be hit if workers vote in favour of action, according to the union Unite.  It claims its members fear for their jobs because of a "damaging culture of blame" within the organisation. Edinburgh Trams said it was disappointed Unite was taking the move before "exhausting internal processes to resolve their concerns".  The union also claims alleged disciplinary action taken against some of its members has been "unreasonable and unjust" but the tram firm says it has confidence in its disciplinary policy.

An award-winning artist is painting portraits of 100 of the 201 men who lost their lives in the Western Isles' Iolaire disaster of 1 January 1919. The naval yacht HMY Iolaire was carrying home hundreds of sailors after the end of World War One. The vessel was wrecked on a reef called the Beasts of Holm near Stornoway, in Lewis. Western Isles-based artist Margaret Ferguson's portraits will help to mark 100 years since the disaster. Her great-uncle was among those who lost their lives.

Guilty of abuse

The conviction of Jim Torbett for child sex abuse for the second time marks the end of another chapter in the story of how a paedophile used football as a cover for his crimes.  Torbett founded Celtic Boys Club in 1966 as a club closely aligned with Celtic FC. He was no footballing tactician, nor was he especially liked by his peers, but he was on good terms with the Celtic board. Indeed it was Celtic's legendary manager Jock Stein and former chairman Sir Robert Kelly who gave the young man permission to start the boys club, using Celtic's name and colours. It would provide the perfect cover for a man whose offending spanned four decades. 


Crystal Maze

Researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh have created a "crystal maze" to control how light spreads.   However, unlike the Channel 4 TV game show, this one is telling scientists more about how light can be manipulated.   It could also lead to new and better devices in fields like healthcare and telecommunications.   This is part of the fledgling field of topological photonics, which has developed as a result of the drive to understand more about how matter behaves.   In 2016 Bearsden-born David J Thouless shared the Nobel physics prize with Duncan Haldane and Michael Kosterlitz for their work on topological phases of matter.

Eliza Coulson, who is 20 years old, turned her personal experience into award-winning art after she was sexually harassed by a man she had just met. "He made me feel as if it was normal, although I knew I felt uncomfortable," she says. "I was scared." The events contributed to the creation of a project on "self-love, self-worth, and self-empowerment". "I used my art as a means to process what I'd had been through," she says. Now, she uses her art as a means to empower others. A year later, she was named Young Photographer of the Year at the Scottish Portrait Awards 2018. Eliza has told the BBC Scotland news website how art helped her channel positivity into her life and the lives of others.

A Glasgow project is using unwanted food to try to tackle poverty and help protect the environment.  Crookston Community Group (CCG) began as a food bank service providing parcels to struggling locals.  Now they collect unwanted food from businesses when notified through community partner FareShare and they pass it on.  Some of the unwanted food is close to the recommended sell-by date but a lot is fresh and suitable to eat.  They hope to help people who are hungry and the environment at the same time, by diverting food which would usually go to landfill.
