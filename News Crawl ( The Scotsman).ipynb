      "Both roads have been closed since Tuesday, forcing motorists to make a diversion of nearly 60 miles, but transport secretary Michael Matheson said a “safety first” approach was paramount. \n",
      "He said: “The landslides at the Rest and Be Thankful this week have been some of the most challenging in recent memory, both for the community and for the teams working in difficult conditions.\n",

      "Among the clichés of Scottish life, none is more irritating than “the new Highland Clearances” when applied by the intellectually challenged to circumstances bearing no relationship to the original.\n",
      "No surprise then that Christina McKelvie MSP regards Brexit as “the new Highland Clearances” on grounds so convoluted as to be not worth repeating. So far as I am aware, not even Jacob Rees-Mogg plans to burn us out our homes for voting to Remain.\n",
      "Ms McKelvie last came to this column’s attention when she tweeted that “unionists will be a right miserable bunch tonight” after Scotland’s momentous rugby victory over England. I suggested she should be sacked as convener of Holyrood’s Equalities Committee on grounds that she clearly held some Scots to be more equal than others.\n",
      "Instead, in recognition of her wit and wisdom, she was elevated to become Minister for Older People, whatever that entails. Some saw this as compensation for the redeployment of her domestic partner, Keith Brown, who is now in charge of addressing flag-waving rabbles in the public parks of Scotland.\n",
      "READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: Brexit makes Scottish independence ‘inevitable’\n",
      "I do not subscribe to this theory and accept that Ms McKelvie was appointed on her merits since that tells us a lot more about the available talent pool. At least it is to her credit that she said something worth reporting at the SNP conference, even if it was on grounds of risibility.\n",
      "What of the rest? In terms of debate, it made rallies of the Tory faithful look like hotbeds of dissent. No debate was allowed on either “Indyref2” or the economic masterplan drawn up by Andrew Wilson which promises an additional decade of austerity in the event of independence. And that was his good news.\n",
      "The role of the SNP faithful is to provide patriotic applause but what exactly were they applauding? The dismal record on education? The ruthless treatment of local government? The crisis in Scottish health boards? The stagnant state of our economy? None of these was challenged. Just a procession of empty boasts and set-piece speeches.\n",
      "If a Labour government was doing a fraction of the damage to council services that is being inflicted by Ms Sturgeon and her colleagues, there would be so much fire and fury from party members and trade unionists that retreat would follow. That’s what should make political activism matter – but not for those whose sole focus is the constitution.\n",
      "READ MORE: Letters: Avoid tartan blindness, Scotland can’t afford independence\n",
      "Behind the bravura and soft interviews, there was one substantive revelation – that “IndyRef2” is officially a mirage until “the fog of Brexit clears”. How they all clapped, spurred on by appeals to “patience” and “vision”, apparently oblivious to the fact that four years of kidology had just been declared null and void.\n",
      "The “fog of Brexit” will not clear any time soon. Withdrawal is scheduled for next year with a minimum of two years’ transition, probably longer. By then, I guess, some things will be better, some worse and none apocalyptic. The “new Highland Clearances” will not have occurred nor indeed – in deference to Sir Thomas Devine – the Lowland ones either.\n",
      "Ms Sturgeon has acknowledged out of necessity what has long been apparent – there is no appetite for a second referendum, no conceivable justification for it in the midst of negotiations that will affect every aspect of Scottish life, as much as the rest of the UK, and no prospect of any Prime Minister in his or her right mind agreeing to it.\n",
      "So it has all been one big, ongoing publicity stunt. That begs a question, which is largely for Scotland’s broacasters to answer. If the same nonsense kicks off again, manoeuvring for the now officially distant objective of a second referendum, while Scotland’s interests in the Brexit negotiations and much else play second fiddle, will Ms Sturgeon be treated with the same deference?\n",
      "Meanwhile, great to  be reminded there is still a place for grown-up politics capable of good outcomes. If a change of policy is forced on the foolish underfunding of Universal Credit, to protect those who would suffer, that will be worth waving a flag for.\n",

      "More than 30 leading business groups including the CBI and the Scotch Whisky Association have expressed concern about proposals to introduce a new local authority rates levy on out-of-town businesses.\n",
      "The groups have made their reservations known in their responses to a Scottish Government consultation on the controversial proposals.\n",
      "The Barclay Review of business rates commissioned by Scottish ministers included plans for a number of pilot councils to be given the power to increase rates paid by “out of town” and “predominantly online” businesses.\n",
      "The proposal was put forward in an attempt to make it more attractive to do business in towns and regenerate town centres.\n",
      "But preliminary analysis of consultation responses by the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) has found 31 business organisations have expressed reservations about the plan. They include CBI Scotland, the Scotch Whisky Association, the Food and Drink Federation and Scottish Engineering. \n",
      "The SRC has renewed its calls for finance secretary Derek Mackay to ditch the proposal.\n",
      "CBI Scotland warned: “An additional levy would in short create more complexity, unpredictability and cost to a wide range of businesses that are already working hard to contribute to their local communities.”\n",
      "The Federation of Small Businesses said a new levy “could create local divisions”.\n",
      "And the Scottish Chambers of Commerce said the proposed scheme risked “unfairly punishing those who have opted for specific business models”. \n",
      "The Scotch Whisky Association said it was “not in favour of an out-of-town additional levy”. “It could disadvantage sites that are based in rural locations or out-of-town centres,” the association said in its submission.\n",
      "Scottish Engineering added it was “extremely concerned over the proposal to empower all local authorities to levy additional business rates surcharges on out-of-town businesses and we urge the government not to proceed with this aspect of the overall proposals”.\n",
      "SRC director David Lonsdale said: “A formidable and broad cross-section of Scottish business and industry are voicing serious doubts over the wisdom of progressing with this new tax, which will simply introduce further complexity and cost into the business rates system.\n",
      "“The questions around the scheme, who would be liable, what the tax rate would be, how long it would apply for and where the revenues would go have mounted as business groups from across Scotland’s economy have considered the government’s proposed new tax.”\n",
      "A Scottish Government spokesperson said: “The Barclay Review was established to review the current non-domestic rates system to support growth, improve administration and increase fairness. The Scottish Government is committed to delivering the Barclay Review as part of our commitment to maintaining a competitive non-domestic rates regime for businesses in Scotland and we provide the most competitive system of rates relief in the UK.\n",
      "“The consultation concluded on 17 September and we are currently analysing the responses to inform the delivery of these reforms.”\n",

      "The terms of the deal means Mr Ashley would pay more for the freehold to the building than the £90m he paid for the entire House of Fraser chain when he moved to save it from administration in August, on top of an existing 11 per cent stake he owned.

      "As many as one in three UK homeowners do not know what mortgage rate they are on, potentially costing them thousands of pounds each year, according to new research from consumer group Which?\n",
      "Only three in ten (28 per cent) homeowners in Scotland knew their exact mortgage rate, with nearly four in ten (37 per cent) knowing the approximate rate.\n",
      "Which? Mortgage Advisers, who surveyed more than 3,500 homeowners across the country, revealed borrowers with an average-priced home could end up paying as much as £347 a month – more than £4,000 a year – more on their lender’s standard variable rate (SVR).\n",
      "Researchers said there was a “clear level of apathy” over mortgage deals. Four in ten (41 per cent) of those on SVR explained they would be unlikely to switch if they came across a cheaper deal today.\n",
      "Those most financially informed were Londoners and 18 to 24-year-olds when it came to knowing their mortgage rate.\n",
      "Eighty per cent and 74 per cent respectively knew the exact or approximate figure respectively.\n",
      "Homeowners in Wales were the least likely to know their mortgage rate, with just one in five (18 per cent) knowing the exact figure and four in ten (40 per cent) knowing the approximate figure.\n",
      "Of those on SVR who had been on the same mortgage for at least the past five years, when asked why they had not switched one in five (22 per cent) said it was not worth the effort. One in seven (15 per cent) claimed they had not thought about it.\n",
      "David Blake, principal at Which? Mortgage Advisers, said customers needed to be pro-active about their finances. \n",
      "“I would urge anyone with a mortgage to check what interest rate you’re on and whether you’re paying more than you need to,” he said. “The remortgage market is highly competitive at the moment, so there’s a good chance that remortgaging will save you money.”\n",
      "One in four (25 per cent) of those who took part in the survey were on their mortgage lender’s SVR, usually costing more than other products available from the same provider.\n",
      "The survey showed 55 per cent of homeowners were on fixed rates, 10 per cent on trackers and 5 per cent on discount rates. Gerry MacDonald, an Edinburgh-based independent mortgage financial adviser, said people should get regular “money health check-ups”.\n",
      "“The majority of people leave it until they are really struggling to stretch their pay packets before they think of going to speak to their own mortgage adviser about the problem,” he said.\n",
      "“However, independent advice is the better option and equips them with the financial literacy they need now.””\n",

      "Alex McLeish has launched a stirring defence of his worth and methods amidst a rising ",
      "tide of criticism following Scotland’s 2-1 defeat by Israel.\n",
      "The manager stressed that the fans’ unhappy reaction in Haifa simply made him more determined to get the national side back on track. Supporters were quick to voice their displeasure after Scotland, who had John Souttar sent off after an hour, suffered one of their worst defeats in modern times.\n",
      "He has called for fans to stick with him and the team as they attempt to recover from the setback. Scotland face an unappetising clash with Ronaldo-less Portugal in a friendly tomorrow evening at Hampden Park before next month’s vital Nations League double-header against Albania and Israel.\n",
      "“I am a masochist,” said McLeish. “I’ve never flinched from a challenge and I’m not going to start now. No way. The more criticism I get the more determined I will be to turn it around.\n",
      "“I will probably hear about the criticism coming my way – but I will probably not read it. If there is good information there for me to take, then of course… you can always take that.\n",
      "“You get kicked and say, ‘I’m going to show everybody’. I need to bounce back and the players need to bounce back.”\n",
      "He said management was “in his DNA” and he was not going to walk away from the challenge. Handed a two-year contract in February by the Scottish Football Association,  there are already calls for him to go after five defeats from his opening seven games. Last month’s win over Albania had appeared to buy him some time but now everything rests on next month’s games. Qualification for the Nations League play-offs and a potential backdoor route into Euro 2020 remains in Scotland’s hands.\n",
      "“I think your next challenge is always your biggest challenge,” said McLeish. “‘I am determined to see it through and get the team to the level where you guys all like it and the supporters especially.\n",
      "“That’s my challenge and I have never flinched from a challenge. When people put the boot in I tend to bounce back.\n",
      "“‘We have slipped down the rankings over a number of years and we have a lot of clawing back to do. Some of it will be clawing back and some of it we hope will see us produce the football we want to see – you never know, but we want to win. \n",
      "“It’s not all the end of the world,” he added. “It might feel like that now. I don’t feel too good, I will hopefully wake up in the morning with a new perspective.”\n",
      "McLeish urged fans not to desert the cause. He said he could understand their anger and hinted there might be other contributing factors than just Thursday night’s loss.  \n",
      "“When we don’t win the fans don’t like it,” he said. “I don’t know what the reason for it was, if it was just the defeat. I support the fans. I know what it’s like, I’ve played with Scotland before.\n",
      "“I’ve been in the crowd as a kid growing up and seen some great games. I’ve also seen some games where we lost and I know the reactions when Scotland don’t win. They love their country, the punters, and we need them.\n",

      "Gorgeous George and I are discussing clothes and his love for them. George Graham, who was also nicknamed Stroller, developed a taste for high-end tailoring having gone through childhood with the backside falling out of his short trousers. I mention the modelling he did for luxury labels like Aquascutum and ask what’s the most he’s ever spent on clobber  ",
      "but he won’t say, possibly out of not wanting to appear boastful.\n",
      "Then later, towards the end of our chat, as he describes how his arthritis has required seven operations, how he won’t go to the football now because being this slow on his feet would mark him as a “nuisance” and how he can only play golf if he rides in a buggy, I’m thinking he might be favouring footwear that’s synthetically soft and utilitarian for those sore ankles and knees. Then he says: “I’ve just bought some new shoes. Really smart, they are – in fact I ended up getting two pairs. British leather but Italian design – it has to be Italian. A thousand quid.”\n",
      "Standards must be maintained if you’re Gorgeous George. “I like to look smart, always have,” he adds. “If I’m taking my wife to a restaurant I’ll always put on a suit, shirt and tie and a nice silk handkerchief. But there will often be a bloke in jeans and possibly ",
      "trainers, too. The world has gone  ",
      "casual and it upsets me.”\n",
      "You can perfectly understand why  ",
      "the 73-year-old Graham, a Double- ",
      "winner with Arsenal who then bossed the Gunners to a sensational title before being sacked in disgrace, would end up going after the finer things in life when he tells you about his upbringing. Forty-seven years ago tonight Graham made his Scotland debut against Portugal. There were five new caps for that Euro Championships qualifier and all of them would have felt pride. But if his team-mates were to have contemplated how they’d got to Hampden from their respective starts in life – and if the side for tomorrow’s friendly against the Portuguese were to do the same – then few stories could match that of our man for struggle and sadness.\n",
      "At first when I ask about it Graham thinks I mean simply that he had a working-class background – in his case in Bargeddie in North Lanarkshire – which, as he points out, would have been the status of just about every Scottish boy who dreamed of becoming a footballer. But I’m talking about the tragedy which befell his family on Christmas Day, 1944.\n",
      "“My father died when I was three weeks old,” Graham explains, “so my mother was left with seven kids in a wee council house.” Robert, a steelworker, succumbed to tuberculosis, which would also claim Graham’s sister Mary. But there is little point probing him about feelings; his milieu was the west of Scotland in the immediate post-war years and not California in the 1970s. The family responded to the tragedy with stoicism and hard graft.\n",
      "“I grew up without a father but I didn’t know any different,” he says. “You make the best of a bad job in those situations. Yes, life was tough but I would regard my childhood as happy. It was full of warmth.”\n",
      "Graham’s mother Janet worked as a cleaner and in the fields round Bargeddie while supervising a rota of jobs for her children. “The big pot of soup my mother made had to last the whole family all week. We had to grow our own vegetables. We had to ensure the potatoes were properly stored in what we called ‘the hump’ – a layer of hay, soil then more hay – to last the whole winter. And we had to follow horses round the village collecting fertiliser!\n",
      "“Obviously as the baby of the family I missed these tasks in the beginning but they came to me later. When my father died my eldest brother Andy left school to work on a farm in Ayrshire and he became the family’s breadwinner. He became the man of the house and, for me, a father-figure. That was how I always regarded him. \n",
      "“It was some responsibility for a lad of 16. He went down the mines later which would have been gruelling. Eventually he got a family of his own and proved himself a great father for real. He died a few years ago but I speak to his widow Babs all the time. I never felt deprived because I didn’t know my actual father. I had Andy and that was brilliant. I hope my actual father would have been proud of me getting to play for Scotland but I know Andy was and that was enough. He was a great guy and my hero.”\n",
      "That Portugal game was the first of Tommy Docherty’s tenure as manager following a glum couple of years for the national team. The other new caps were Martin Buchan, Alex Cropley, Eddie Colquhoun and Graham’s Arsenal team-mate Bob Wilson as goalkeeper. Reporting on the 2-1 win, The Scotsman’s John Rafferty applauded a performance of “intelligence, fire and good order”. The Hampden Roar had returned, Rafferty said, because “the crowd had found a manager and he had made a team”, with Graham being “impressively studious” in the midfield. “That’s very polite,” he laughs.\n",
      "“Portugal were a fabulous team back then and I was thrilled to have been a small part in the victory. I was an Anglo, and sometimes guys who played their football in England had to try a bit harder to impress, but I don’t think there are too many folk who leave Scotland who aren’t proud to still be called Scottish and who don’t have that lovely desire to do well in the world. I’d like to think I had it.”\n",
      "In Bargeddie, football was the big – and only – passion. Nothing else distracted Graham; he’s not even sure there was a wireless in the house. Come Christmas, a poignant time, he hoped for a leather football, every boy’s desire, but never got one. “Maybe some other lad did and he became king of the street. We’d all wanted to be his best friend. I did get boots one year, the kind with the rock-hard toecaps. You stood in a bowl of hot water for a couple of hours every night to try and soften them. We played football all day and every day, under the streetlights which became our floodlights, and we honed our skills. Scots were famous for being ball artists, weren’t they? They weren’t physically strong but they were better than the English at dribbling.”\n",
      "If Anglos really had to audition before a tough Hampden crowd then Graham in ’71 was at least able to present a more than respectable cv: the old English First Division and the FA Cup, both having been won five months previously. Scotland saw little live football on TV back then but we were permitted the cup final’s extra-time when a Scot, Frank McLintock, hoisted the trophy for Arsenal and two more bickered over a goal. “Eddie Kelly has always claimed it but I still maintain I got the last touch,” says Graham.\n",
      "By then he was left-half having started out as a centre-forward, being signed as such by Aston Villa then Chelsea, the latter managed by the same Tommy Doc. Oh to be swanning along the King’s Road during the Swinging Sixties – Graham did this. And when he walked through the front door at Stamford Bridge, aged 19, new team-mate John Hollins was so impressed by the shimmering suit and its wearer’s confident stride that he thought the club had signed a model.\n",
      "Graham chuckles at this. “Well, I was determined to make an impact. I promised myself I’d buy some nice clothes when I could afford them because I always had hand-me-downs in Bargeddie. School uniforms would be passed from Andy to Tom then to Robert and when I got them the jackets were always heavily patched. \n",
      "“Was I confident? Well, I was determined to get on. That came from Bargeddie, my upbringing. If I was going to do something with my life then, given my start, I was going to have to put everything into it and work hard. So hard work always came first for me.”\n",
      "We definitely associate the Arsenal team he managed with hard work. Think of the mean defence he assembled, sparking the jibes of “Boring Arsenal”, which in turn inspired Highbury’s North Bank to chant: “One-nil to the Ars-en-al”. Think, too, of Anders Limpar’s assessment of Graham’s iron rule: “Like living in Iraq under Saddam [Hussein].”    \n",
      "Ah, but hard work having got him to London when it was the centre of the pop-cultural universe, Graham slowed up. At Chelsea he had a groovy time away from the pitch and there’s an old quote which goes: “I wasn’t exactly a keen trainer. I was more interested in finishing and going off for a vodka and coke, or chasing the lassies.” With another team-mate, Terry Venables, Graham opened a gents outfitters. “It was in Soho and Norman Wisdom helped promote it. A lovely guy, but because he always wore too-tight jackets and trousers at half-mast in his films, he might not have done us much good!” Graham’s fellow Blues soon coined another nickname for him: Big Fry, after the square-jawed fellow with girls at his feet in chocolate commercials of the time, played by George Lazenby. So that’s three different monikers over the course of his career – four if you count Saddam.\n",
      "Stroller suited him fine. “I was never a great athlete,” he admits. “I couldn’t sprint and I wasn’t the best at winning the ball back or anything physical. But I’d like to think I used what talent I had. I was good on the ball, the Scottish trait, and I could score with a header. I used to tell the lads at Arsenal: ‘There’s only one guy better in the air than me and that’s Douglas Bader’!”\n",
      "The move across London to Highbury happened not long after a wild night in Blackpool for eight Chelsea high-rollers, Graham included. Challenging for the title, the team faced three games in quick succession in England’s north-west and decided to set up camp in the seaside resort but the players were gasping for a bevvy and broke a curfew. The Doc waited up for them like a comic-strip battleaxe. He may not have brandished a rolling pin but he definitely sent the Blackpool Eight home and a side made up of second-stringers were thrashed in the next match. “A silly mistake,” says Graham, and unfortunately it wouldn’t be his last.\n",
      "As a player at Arsenal, where he also won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, Graham appeared to undergo a kind of spiritual conversion. “I came to realise the importance of discipline. Arsenal have always had great standards and that was driven into me from the moment I arrived at the club.” With that reformed outlook it’s perhaps surprising that he didn’t have management in mind when he stopped strolling and hung up his boots. He was pulling pints in McLintock’s pub, thinking he might get one of his own, when Venables, manager at Crystal Palace, asked if he’d like to run the youth team. \n",
      "“I loved coaching right away, couldn’t get enough of it.” His first manager’s job was Millwall and in 1986 he took over at Arsenal, much to McLintock’s amusement, especially given the hard-line demeanour he’d adopt there. “Frank likes to say: ‘George Graham, the manager, would never have picked George Graham, the footballer, for his team.’ It’s true, I wouldn’t.” Arsenal became a force in the game again.\n",
      "“I was lucky. Like Sir Alex [Ferguson] at Manchester United I inherited a group of outstanding young players: [Tony] Adams, [Martin] Keown, [David] Rocastle, [Paul] Davis, [Niall] Quinn. Then I was able to add the best of the lower leagues, [Lee] Dixon, [Steve] Bould and [Nigel] Winterburn, because every Monday I had those green and pink sports finals from the English cities brought to my desk and I knew that scene well. Hungry guys and young talent made for a great combination. I was full of confidence but [managing the team] was an easy job because they all wanted to learn. I was a teacher and they couldn’t get enough information, they loved it. I didn’t mind the sergeant-major reputation. Saddam? That made me laugh.” Nor was he bothered by criticism of his tactics. “I used to say that I planted my bulbs in the garden in a strong defensive line. That was a joke, as was the one about having the Arsenal crest on the bottom of my swimming pool.” He’d just taken over as manager of Spurs and had been asked if he thought the fans would accept a man from the North London rivals.\n",
      "Graham’s Gunners lifted six trophies in nine years and none more dramatic than the 1988-89 championship when Liverpool only needed to avoid losing by two goals at home, but Arsenal pulled off the seemingly impossible. Graham decided the team would head north on the day of the match, a decision based on his reading of Desmond Morris’ The Naked Ape (“The stuff about fighting for territory was fascinating”) and also the hostility experienced on previous trips to Merseyside: “Hotel staff were quite derogatory, telling us to get back to London.”\n",
      "But Graham’s Highbury reign would come crashing down in 1995 when he was sacked by the club and banned for a year by the FA for taking a £425,000 bung from a Norwegian agent following the purchase of two players. The money was handed back, with interest, and he would eventually return to management, but the damage had been done. He accepts his reputation has been tarnished and with it the memory of these redoubtable achievements. “I don’t like to talk about what happened but I know I made a big mistake.”\n",
      "Graham blamed the all-consuming football life for the break-up of his first marriage but, remaining close to his two children, he now lives contentedly in London’s Hampstead with second wife Susan. Another reason he doesn’t go to matches any more is that there are too many old soldiers hanging around the game already. “They must get in the way. I’ve had my time.”\n",
      "His time as a Scotland player ended with his 12th cap. By then he’d left Arsenal for Man U, the wrong move which ended in relegation. “Yes, I was disappointed not to play more for my country but one thing about me is I’ve never been a dreamer. I’m a realist and while I thought I was a good player, I knew I wasn’t special. I was happy being on the periphery and thrilled to make the team, even just a few times.”\n",
      "The boy from Bargeddie did all right, as I’m sure his dad would agree. Both of them.\n",

      "The bank – part of the Weatherbys brand, which is best-known for its activities in horseracing – has now taken a lease on an office in the capital’s Rutland Square that provides it with double the space of its previous base on the same street.\n",

      "Johnston Press, the owner of this newspaper, has put itself up for sale after months of speculation about the company’s future.\n",
      "The group, which owns hundreds of titles including the i newspaper, The Yorkshire Post  and The Scotsman, said it is seeking offers for the company.\n",
      "The decision is part of a strategic review, which JP launched in 2017 to assess options for refinancing £220m of bonds due for repayment next year.\n",
      "The company said it is not currently in discussions with any potential buyers.\n",
      "JP said parties with a potential interest in making a proposal should contact Rothschild.\n",
      "It added that there can be no certainty that an offer will be made, nor that any transaction will be executed, nor as to terms of any such offer or transaction.\n",
      "JP’s CEO David King said: “A sale to a suitable buyer is one of the options available to us as we explore ways to repay our debts and deal with our pension fund deficit. However, there is no certainty that a firm offer will emerge from this process.\n",
      "“This process is about securing a positive future for Johnston Press. In the meantime, it is business as usual. Johnston Press is a strong and resilient business with good profits and strong profit margins, great people and prestigious titles.\n",
      "“I am certain that whatever the future ownership of the company, we will continue to produce our titles long after the end of the strategic review. \n",
      "“Our newspapers and websites continue to perform well against a tough market backdrop. We made £6.2m in pre-tax profits in the first six months of the year.”\n",

      "Bidders for the business could include activist shareholder Custos Group, which already owns more than 20 per cent of JP.\n",
      "At its most recent trading update, JP reported a hit to revenues, mostly due to changes in Google and Facebook algorithms.\n",
      "Total revenue fell 10 per cent to £93m for the first half of 2018, despite a boost from the i newspaper.\n",
      "In the same period, the company swung out of the red with interim pre-tax profits of £6.2m against a loss of £10.2m a year earlier. The turnaround followed a one-off £8.8m accounting gain.\n",

      "WH Smith has proved once again to be a tale of two businesses after launching an overhaul of its under-pressure high street arm while revealing rising sales across its outlets based in airports and train stations.\n",
      "The group, which has 839 travel outlets and 610 high street stores in the UK, has kicked off a detailed review of the high street business which will see it close six branches and wind down trials such as its 20-strong Cardmarket chain and franchised convenience store arm WH Smith Local.\n",
      "It said the move was designed to “better structure the business for the future”. The company, which can trace its roots back to 1792, will also undertake a restructure of some operational activities and increase its focus on core ranges.\n",
      "One-off costs associated with the review sent group pre-tax profits down 4 per cent to £134 million for the year to the end of August. With these costs stripped out, underlying pre-tax profits lifted 4 per cent to £145m.\n",
      "Trading profits at the high street division fell 3 per cent to £60m, but this was offset by a 7 per cent hike in profits at its travel arm to £103m.\n",
      "The firm said high street like-for-like sales slipped 3 per cent, although the “slime” craze helped drive an “encouraging” performance in the final six months of the financial year. Sales were up by 3 per cent across its outlets based in travel locations.\n",
      "Chief executive Stephen Clarke said: “We had a good year in high street despite the well-documented challenges of the UK high street.\n",
      "“During an encouraging second half, the business traded well and we quickly identified the latest trend in the market, becoming a one-stop-shop for all slime-related products.\n",
      "“Despite this good performance, we are not ignoring the broader challenges on the UK high street and, during the second half, we conducted a business review to ensure our high street business is fit for purpose now and for the future.”\n",
      "He added: “Travel accounts for over half our sales and two-thirds of our profits and continues to perform strongly. This performance has been driven by our ongoing investment in stores and growth in passenger numbers.”\n",
      "The board has proposed a final dividend of 38.1p per share, marking a 13 per cent increase on the year before, giving a total dividend for the year of 54.1p, up 12 per cent.\n",
      "John Moore, senior investment manager at Brewin Dolphin Scotland, said: “The key to understanding the WH Smith investment story is that it has cornered the market in areas which have less price sensitivity – stationery and magazines and confectionery at trains and airports, to name a couple.\n",
      "“That’s seen the business fall into the ‘little and often’ retail trade, which tends to be more resilient than other forms of high street shopping.”\n",
      "He added: “WH Smith is also fierce on capital discipline, which has been a key aspect of its high return on capital employed.\n",
      "“The business has returned more than £800m to shareholders in the last decade, which is quite remarkable for a non-FTSE 100 company.\n",
      "“That focus was re-iterated today with a 12 per cent hike in its dividend, to 54.1p per share.”\n"
