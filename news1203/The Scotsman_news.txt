['For the second time in a Hampden cup final, Aberdeen decided to go man-for-man with Celtic, and again it almost worked.', 'READ MORE - Why are defenders allowed to ‘foul’ attackers in the act of shooting?', 'It’s often a gamble for underdogs to use such a tactic. It places a lot of faith in the defenders to win their individual battles and continue doing so throughout the game. Because if one part of the machine starts malfunctioning the whole thing can fall apart. In a zonal system you can sometimes hide a defender having a bad game, because the unit is set up to deny space in the most dangerous areas. In a man-marking system, the safety net isn’t as vast.', 'It can also be seen as playing into the hands of a team that’s great at passing and moving, which Celtic definitely are. Defenders can get dragged around into all sorts of different areas. The obvious example of this from the last two Hampden Park clashes between these sides was Shay Logan continually appearing in central areas as the right-back tracked the inside runs of Scott Sinclair.', 'However, if there’s one strength of this Dons team at present it’s their ability to defend. They are disciplined, they are resolute, and there’s not one member of that unit Derek McInnes doesn’t trust.']**

And the only stocking it would fit into would have to be of the surgical variety.', 'In the never-ending sequence of success that Rodgers is presiding over at the Glasgow club, yesterday’s Betfred Cup final triumph made him the club’s first manager to rack up seven straight domestic trophy wins.

There are no low-cost options when it comes to justice - Karyn McCluskey**

https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/there-are-no-low-cost-options-when-it-comes-to-justice-karyn-mccluskey-1-4838178
['Things that matter cost money. We all know this. We might all love a bargain, (as the record number of sales on US-import as Black Friday shows, but we also understand that there aren’t really that many bargains out there. If you want quality, you have to pay for it.', 'What does quality mean in the context of the justice system? It’s probably the same that we expect from anything else we spend significant amounts of money on we buy: does it work, does it do the job we paid it to do?  ', 'And perhaps that’s where it all starts to get muddy. Our feelings about what justice is and what the justice system should do has, over the years, been buffeted by thundering headlines and grandstanding political sermons. What is fair or unfair towards those have committed crimes or had them committed against them dominates discussions and the eternal struggle is between victims and those who’ve offended. The public narrative is that you can’t be for both.', 'Those of us who have experience of this area – whether professionally or personally – know that, like everything involving human beings, it’s not that simple. Sometimes the victims of crime have been perpetrators and vice versa, sometimes underlying drivers like trauma, deprivation, addiction and mental health trap people in this cycle of offending and offended against. Of course it’s easier to think about ‘good’ and ‘bad’ people and it’s not so comfortable to think about those orbiting the justice system as vulnerable and in need of help, but the hard facts are: it’s true.', 'So what does this have to do with quality and value for money? In Scotland we spend a vast amount on justice, funding the police, courts, custody and community sentences. We should absolutely expect for these vital public services to be based upon the best evidence of what works to give us maximum bang for our buck. What works to prevent crime, prevent further harm and improve lives. To do that, it has to be responsive to specific situations and use with the right tool for the job. It must meet people as individuals with particular needs, strengths and weaknesses. Something as expensive as our justice system should be modern, smart, innovative and use the best methods available to reduce crime, reduce the number of victims and help people become productive, healthy citizens. But despite the ‘best evidence’ telling us that short periods in prison are not the most effective way to deliver this, we still have an unacceptably high prison population – nudging 8,000 as you read this.

['What’s life really like in a globe-trotting, festival-topping, China-touring five-piece? Fiona Shepherd finds out', 'Since their formative days on Glasgow’s DIY indie scene, Franz Ferdinand have always been the band you want playing at your party. Their earliest gigs were at a series of now-legendary private-ish arty party nights they would throw in the ironically named Chateau, a rundown warehouse space just south of the Clyde. But they were destined for much bigger happenings – not least Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, which was quick to spot their potential and booked them to open the Concert in the Gardens in 2003.', 'Drummer Paul Thomson reckons this would have been about their 15th gig as a band – had it not been cancelled due to wild weather. Undeterred, the band went searching for an alternative gig that night and appropriately pitched up at a house party. “It was very last minute,” recalls Thomson. “I think there was a band that rehearsed in the flat so we just used all their gear. We were psyched up to play so we were desperately looking for another party.”', 'Thomson was particularly keen to return to Edinburgh’s Hogmanay – this time at the top of the bill – because of the many times he attended the street party as a teenager.', '“The motivation for going into town in Edinburgh was to try to meet new people,” he recalls. “Everybody always seemed to be a lot friendlier on Hogmanay, probably because they were drunk. Obviously I picked up on that as a kid from going to Hogmanay parties at my grandparents’. Everybody is inexplicably very happy, having a great time, what’s going on here?”']**

And as Perth Concert Hall prepares to host those same Scots Trad Music Awards and Gala Concert tonight – the “folk Oscars” – both bands have again been nominated for recognition, with Ímar shortlisted with nine other contenders for the Folk Band of the Year Category and Talisk for a prestigious £25,000 Belhaven Bursary for Innovation in Music, the largest cash prize of its kind in Scotland.', 'Tonight’s awards bash, which sees the folk world turn out in best bib and tucker, will see live performances from such distinguished names as Croft No  5, Karine Polwart, Mànran and Gerda Stevenson. Between acts, presenters Mary Ann Kennedy and Kim Carnie will announce the results for the 17 award categories, public voting on which closed last Friday.', 'On this occasion, says Amini, who returns from touring Denmark with Talisk the day before the gala, he won’t be playing – “I’ll just be sitting back biting my nails”.', '“They’re always really good for your career,” he says of awards. “When we started Talisk four years ago, we won the Radio 2 award and that pushed us into all these realty big festivals like Cambridge and Cropredy, so that gave us a massive step up. Then when I won the Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician in 2017, it was around the same time that we launched Ímar, so that helped push our album.']**
