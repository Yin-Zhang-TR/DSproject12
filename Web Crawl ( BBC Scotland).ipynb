      "As an aspiring composer from Inverness, Lorne Balfe wrote a letter to renowned Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer, asking if he could work for free in order to gain experience.Over the course of his training, Balfe progressed to co-compose Hollywood soundtracks with Zimmer before branching out into scoring films and TV on his own.In his early days, Balfe worked on Scottish institution River City; since then, he has gone on to become one of Hollywood’s most sought-after composers.Along with his most recent work for BBC One drama The Cry, here are just some of the scores that put Lorne Balfe firmly on the map.\n",
      "Working with Hans Zimmer meant getting experience on high-profile Hollywood productions. As a film composer in his own right, Lorne has worked on blockbusters like Mission: Impossible – Fallout and Terminator Genisys.\n",
      "Lorne first made a name for himself as a composer working on the BBC Scotland children’s show Shoebox Zoo, which starred Peter Mullan and Jason Connery. Interestingly, Lorne’s big break with Shoebox Zoo came from being hired by the show’s Exec Producer Claire Mundell – also the Exec Producer of The Cry – who is such a fan of Lorne’s talent that she handpicked him to score this latest drama. After Shoebox Zoo, Lorne later moved on to River City.\n",
      "Working on animated films as co-composer with Hans Zimmer allowed Lorn to progress to the point of composing animated feature films – like Megamind and Penguins of Madagascar – on his own.\n",
      "Lorne has also worked on some of the biggest-selling computer game titles of recent times, like Assassin’s Creed III and FIFA 19.\n",

      "“I was totally unprepared. Trainers, jeans and a shower curtain of a cagoule and that was it.\n",
      "“I kept going even when people told me to turn back. In a way I shouldn’t have but in every way thank goodness for me that I did.”\n",

      "“I went to see a play on Broadway that Alan Cumming was in and wanted to know where he went to school. I made a decision that I wasn’t going to audition for any other school.”\n",
      "The school in question was The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland — the same institution that taught Cumming his craft many years earlier.\n",
      "But Caroline’s path to gaining a place at one of the most prestigious acting schools in the world wasn’t an easy one.\n",
      "As she explained to BBC The Social, Caroline’s upbringing was difficult.\n",
      "“When I was 16, my mom, my sisters and I lost basically everything. We would beg for food and for money — whatever we could to survive.”\n",
      "Even when Caroline and her family managed to find a place to live, there were still issues.\n",
      "“There was a lot of mould ... all of us were affected. I had it grow on my face, on my neck, my back; we were all malnourished.”\n",
      "“Yes those things are sad, but they don’t have to be sad. It can change somebody’s perspective and inspire them to say ‘Hey, okay I’m going through this right now, but that’s not the end.’”\n",
      "Caroline auditioned successfully and gained a place at the prestigious acting school in Glasgow, a city gaining popularity as a filming location for American TV series and Hollywood movies.\n",
      "The generosity of family, friends, and donors to an online crowd-funding campaign helped Caroline turn her dream move to Glasgow into a reality.\n",
      "“I’m able to eat because people are helping me; I’m able to pay tuition because people are helping me. I have to pay that forward.”\n",
      "Even though she has gone through more than most in order to try and achieve her dream, Caroline refuses to let it define her as an actor.\n",
      "“It’s important for me to not tell Caroline’s story to these people,” she explains. Instead, her focus is on the stories of the roles she plays — “because that is why I’m chosen to do this.”\n",
