      "There was a flurry of excitement amongst senior SNP figures when a new survey reportedly showed an uptick in support for independence following Brexit, writes Murdo Fraser.\n",
      "Amongst those caught up in the euphoria was the SNP’s head of communications, a senior strategist and their Deputy Leader, Keith Brown. Even Nicola Sturgeon felt heartened enough to retweet the supposed “findings” of this poll.\n",
      "However, before breaking out the bubbly and a fresh batch of Yes2 stickers, the SNP would have done well to analyse what the poll – commissioned by Channel 4 news from Survation – actually said.\n",
      "The Survation poll didn’t ask respondents about how they would vote in a second independence referendum, but instead asked how Brexit would affect their vote – whether they were more or less likely to support independence. These are two completely different things.\n",
      "READ MORE: SNP claim Brexit ‘chaos’ will result in Scottish independence majority\n",
      "This misunderstanding led to a remarkable situation where Survation had to publically correct an SNP strategist for misrepresenting their findings – a reminder to all, that everyone has a duty to challenge fake news.  \n",
      "Furthermore, in a separate question, a clear majority of respondents – 57 to 38 per cent – said they would be concerned by the prospect of independence. Clear evidence, if we needed it, that public opinion on “indyref 2” hasn’t changed.\n",
      "As the leading psephologist Professor Sir John Curtice consistently points out, no evidence exists to suggest Brexit has significantly shifted public opinion on Scottish independence, despite the constant grievance-mongering from SNP HQ.\n",
      "And whilst many Scottish voters regret the fact that we are leaving the EU, they also realise that separating Scotland from the rest of the UK would do far more damage.\n",

      "A remarkable, perfectly preserved 2,000-year-old wooden bowl unearthed from a well on Orkney can be seen for the first time.\n",
      "The bowl was discovered over the summer in an underground chamber at The Cairns Broch archaeology site on South Ronaldsay.\n",
      "It is hoped the object will shed further light on what the mysterious underground chambers were used for - and who was using them.\n",
      "READ MORE: Discovery of ‘astonishing’ 2,000 year old hair on Orkney. \n",
      "On-going conservation work has given an exceptionally rare glimpse of the wooden vessel which was held in a block of water-logged soil.\n",
      "Conservators at AOC Archaeology, based in Edinburgh, this week removed the bowl from its surrounds to give a clear view of the object for the first time in 2,000 years.\n",
      "READ MORE: Site of huge Iron Age feast found on Orkney\n",
      "The very finely carved vessel has an  exceptionally smooth finish, appearing almost burnished, with tool marks visible inside. \n",
      "It had been skilfully hand carved from a half-log of an alder tree. \n",
      "Although the object has split into two large pieces and about twenty smaller pieces at some point in the past, it is largely complete. \n",
      "Conservators believe that an intricate repair job was once carried out on the bowl after small strips of bronze were detected on its surface with a larger strip running across the break.\n",
      "The repair job suggests the importance of the bowl in an Orkney context with the repair technique never seen before from the British Iron Age period.\n",
      "Martin Carruthers, lecturer in archaeology at the UHI Archaeology Institute, Orkney Collect and director of The Cairn Project, said: “After first encountering the bowl this summer, we had wondered if wooden bowls, and other objects made from wood, might actually have been much more common than we would have previously expected for the mostly treeless environment of Iron Age Orkney. \n",
      "“Perhaps archaeologists have been guilty of overplaying the scarcity of wood in Scotland’s Northern Isles.  \n",
      "“Maybe there were almost as many wooden vessels in circulation as there were ceramic ones, fragments of which we recover in great numbers from sites like The Cairns. \n",
      "“The bowl discovery made us ask an important question: was the survival of the bowl in the well merely an outcome of the unique quality of preservation down there, or was its presence there also reflective of other special qualities accorded that place by people in the Iron Age? I think the biography of the bowl that is emerging could well help us answer these questions”. \n",
      "Mr Carruthers added: “If the bowl was used within the well, and not just placed there at the end of its life, then perhaps this is telling us something about the nature of the well, and how it was used. \n",
      "“The great care that was taken over the repair of the wooden bowl to extend its life tends to suggest that such items were not actually common, and the Cairns bowl seems to have been highly valued.” \n",
      "Dr Anne Crone, a specialist in ancient wooden artefacts with AOC Archaeology, who is providing specialist analysis of the bowl, says, “The rarity of wooden vessels in Orkney could be why they went to such lengths to repair what is a quite beautiful object”. \n",

      "A FAMILY say they have been “completely failed” by their local authority after being forced to change their daughters’ school over a harrowing five-year campaign of bullying by another student – because social services prevented them removing the child from the class.\n",
      "Daisy Showler, nine, was subjected to vile death threats, mental and physical abuse by a fellow pupil at Stobhill Primary in Gorebridge, leaving her “frightened and anxious” to attend school.\n",
      "But when mum Lynsey, 38, raised concerns with local  ",
      "education services, she was told the school was unable to take the pupil out of the class due to the involvement of social workers in her home life.\n",
      "She added the authority had warned the family they were “unable to guarantee Daisy’s safety”, with one member of staff commenting it would be “better” if they were to move her to another school.\n",
      "Lynsey and husband Darren have since removed Daisy and twin sister Millie, but admits the girls are “absolutely devastated” at the prospect of leaving their friends behind.\n",
      "She said: “It feels like we are being punished for the behaviour of another child.”\n",
      "“Daisy was always this really bubbly, outgoing, friendly girl, but now, she is just so withdrawn. She is at the stage now where she is on high alert, constantly anxious, her adrenaline is always pumping.”\n",
      "Lynsey added: “It is heartbreaking, soul destroying to see her like that, to be constantly worrying about how she is and wondering what is happening until they come home.”\n",
      "The other student, who cannot be named, was reportedly banned from taking part in arts and crafts lessons with other pupils over concerns about her being near sharp objects.\n",
      "Mum-of-four Lynsey said the girl repeatedly made threats to stab Daisy with a pair of scissors and frequently taunted her with “throat slitting” gestures.\n",
      "She added Daisy repeatedly suffered bruised ribs, black eyes and a burst lip at the hands of the girl – who began her bullying campaign just days after the pair attended school for the first time.\n",
      "Staff at the school put in place a series of temporary measures, including having extra teachers in the classroom, but none have worked and the two ended up being placed in separate rooms during lessons.\n",
      "Lynsey revealed the local education board had investigated the school’s handling of the situation and found they had followed procedures correctly.\n",
      "However, she said the system was “failing other students”, adding: “I have total sympathy with the other girl. I understand that her home life is difficult and it would be easy to fly off the handle, but we have tried to conduct ourselves in the most measured way possible because.”\n",
      "“There is this constant changeover because they cannot be in the same class, so both hers and Daisy’s learning is being disrupted and that’s not to mention the effect it’s having on the other children in the class, there is a huge knock-on effect.”\n",
      "She continued: “I believe there is a duty of care for the school, so when we drop our kids at the gates, we need them to be in a safe environment.”\n",
      "“To say it is a welfare issue for the other girl, I understand it, but at a certain point, it becomes about the welfare of my own little girl, I have to know that she is going to school and she is safe.”\n",
      "The family said they are now considering legal action.\n",

      "The tyre manufacturer, Michelin, has been accused of “betrayal” after announcing plans to close its factory in Dundee, just 18 months after receiving £4.5m in public funding to safeguard its future. \n",
      "Some 845 people are employed at the plant, which has been a presence in the city since 1971. \n",
      "The French firm said that despite efforts to make the factory “economically sustainable,” it was now considered “unsuitable,” with the prospect of its conversion not “financially viable.” \n",
      "However, unions described the closure as a “hammer blow” and “devastating,” and pledged to fight “tooth and nail” to save the factory.\n",
      "The impending closure of the plant, which manufactures 16 inch and smaller tyres for cars, is likely to spark a political row. \n",
      "Only last June, the firm received £4.5m of taxpayers’ money to bankroll an expansion programme, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hailing Michelin’s “continued commitment.” \n",
      "Since 2012/13, it has received a further eight grants from Scottish Enterprise totalling more than £5.2m. The majority came via the business quango’s regional selective assistance scheme. \n",
      "In a statement issued on its website, Michelin said the Dundee site has “faced serious difficulties in recent years,” with an “accelerated shift” in the market towards what it described as “low cost, entry level products from Asia.” \n",
      "It stated: “Despite the group’s continuous efforts, and the factory employees’ dedication to making the site economically sustainable through the implementation of several action plans – €70m (£61m) has been invested in recent years to modernise the site – the accelerated market transformation has made the plant unsuitable and its conversion is not financially viable. \n",
      "“Against this backdrop, the Michelin group has had to announce its intention to employees to close the Dundee factory by mid 2020. \n",
      "“The priority now is to provide the 845 employees of the factory with the most effective support possible to enable them to face the consequences of this difficult decision.”\n",
      "It said measures would include enhanced redundancy packages and early retirement, with a “comprehensive plan” to help employees due to be put in place “as quickly as possible.”\n",
      "Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of the Unite union, said: “Unite has been aware of the challenging market situation facing the Michelin group. This has been primarily due to the cheap foreign imports from Asia and as a result falling demand for premium tyres in smaller dimensions, which the Dundee factory specialises in producing. \n",
      "“If the media reports are confirmed by Michelin, this will be hammer blow for Dundee. It would be devastating and a betrayal of the workforce who have made major changes to working practices at the site in order to secure its long-term future. \n",
      "“The workforce can be assured Unite will fight tooth and nail to save our factory, we will leave no stone unturned to keep this factory open. Unite will work day and night to ensure that all options remain on the table.”\n",
      "Shona Robison, the SNP MSP for Dundee, descibrd the news as “deeply upsetting for the city and in particular for the workforce and their families.” \n",
      "Stating that she would be seeking “urgent clarification” from the company about its plans, she added: “If this speculation is true, I will work with the Scottish Government, Dundee City Council and any others to ensure that we do everything possible to secure a future for the Michelin plant and its workforce.”\n",
      "Richard Leonard, the leader of Scottish Labour, said: “This is devastating news for the Michelin workforce and their families, the city of Dundee and the wider Tayside community. My thoughts are with them.\n",
      "“The Michelin factory in Dundee has provided not just hundreds of well paid jobs, but much needed skills and training to a city which has suffered greatly as a result of deindustrialisation.\n",
      "“It is now key that the Scottish Government does everything it possibly can to keep the factory open and protect jobs. This should include working closely with Michelin, trade unions and the Dundee community to provide urgent clarity on the current situation.\n",
      "“Scottish Labour stands ready to provide constructive support to help Michelin workers and keep the factory open.”\n",
      "Last June, Ms Sturgeon announced Scottish Enterprise would commit £4.5m in the form of an environmental protection grant towards a £16.5m investment in the facility, with the company making up the remainder of the funding. \n",
      "The investment was the latest in a series of major cash injections for the factory in recent years and was expected to secure the workforce for the next 10 to 15 years.\n",
      "The Scottish Government said the money, earmarked for additional premises and new manufacturing equipment, would pave the way for a new manufacturing technique that would help reduce CO2 emissions by 7,140 tonnes per year. \n",
      "Speaking while on a tour of the plant at the time, Ms Sturgeon said: “Michelin is a global leader in developing the latest technology and this investment in making the next generation of fuel efficient tyres is another great example of a highly innovative company.\n",
      "“This commitment and investment in the Dundee site will support the 850 fantastic, skilled workers here to remain at the cutting edge of their industry and help the worldwide drive to the low carbon economy.”\n",
      "She added: “Michelin’s investment in Scotland is testament to our thriving manufacturing industry and its position as a key growth sector for the economy. Their continued commitment is proof of the skill and value of the Scottish workforce.”\n",
      "In September, the company - headquartered in Clermont-Ferrand in the Auvergne region of France - said the Dundee factory was continuing to face “extremely challenging trading conditions,” in large part due to the influx from cheap tyres from Asia, and falling demand for smaller, premium tyres. \n",
      "It said that production was forecast to reach 5.4 million tyres a year over the next three years, a number that was “significantly below capacity.” \n",
      "It is understood the plant’s peak production capacity exceeds seven million tyres a year. \n",
      "However, it did not raise the possibility of the factory’s closure, stating only that it would “explore all options to maximise the efficiency of the plant,” which included the prospect of a reduced headcount and restructured working patterns. \n",

      "Annualised cost savings of £70 million have now been achieved, with another £8 million to be added.\n",
      "As part of the turnaround, New Look has also improved its UK market share and ramped up online operations, increasing click and collect sales by 41% in the first half.\n",
      "Mr McGeorge warned that conditions on the high street remain challenging.\n",
      "“We continue to work hard to accelerate our progress, but we are facing into significant headwinds and uncertainties, including Brexit,” he said.\n",

      "While Rangers recorded a loss of £14.3million, Celtic’s profit after tax was £15.4million, aided by profit on player sales of £16.5million. The Ibrox side’s was £1.2million largely made up of Martyn Waghorn and Barrie McKay moving to England.\n",
      "The club have made strides with regards to their revenue.\n",
      "The blogger wrote: “Since their promotion to the Premiership in 2016, Rangers revenue has grown by almost 50 per cent (£10.5m) from £22.2m to £32.7m. Over half of this growth has come from gate receipts and hospitality (£5.6m), but there were also increases in commercial (£2.5m) and broadcasting (£2.3m).”\n",
      "It, however, pales in comparison to Celtic whose revenue for the past year was £101.6million.\n",
      "“In the last 6 seasons, Celtic have benefited from nearly £300m more revenue than their Glasgow rivals,” said Swiss Ramble.\n",
      "“European competition is one of the main reasons for the hefty revenue difference between Rangers and Celtic, who have earned £102m in prize money alone, particularly from the Champions League.”\n",
      "Match day income is key for Rangers with the £23million making up 70 per cent of their revenue. Celtic brought in £32.4million from match day.\n",
      "There was a substantial difference in commercial income, Celtic bringing in £36.6million compared to Rangers’ £5.3million, which was more than £1million less than Aberdeen.\n",
      "Celtic’s varied and fruitful revenue streams allow them to spend big on wages (£59.3million), while keeping their wages to turnover ratio relatively low (58 per cent). \n",
      "Rangers wages were £24million, amounting to a 74 per cent wages to turnover ratio.\n",
      "The disparity between the two Glasgow giants is best summed up by their respective cash balances. Celtic’s sits at £42.6million, while Rangers is a lowly £1.5million, which is below Hibs for this year and is lower than Hearts, Aberdeen and St Johnstone’s 2016/2017 figures.\n",

      "If you are to achieve your savings goals and ambitions, it’s always better to start planning now rather than later.\n",
      "“The hardest thing for many people is having clearly defined objectives,” explains Edinburgh-based wealth manager Bob Hair, who heads up the Cazenove Capital office in the city.\n",
      "“People tend to spend surplus income - only to then wonder why they never have any surplus income.”\n",
      "By that, Bob means many people will, quite naturally, treat themselves or other family members instead of meeting the saving targets they have established.\n",
      "“The key thing is having those objectives, no matter when you start. It’s a relatively simple thing to quantify how much you need to save to achieve that objective.\n",
      "“But you’ve got to be clear - and then commit and get on with it. That’s where most people fall down. It’s not lacking the will - it’s just not doing it.”\n",
      "While pensions are the bedrock for saving for your retirement, building investments on top of that is key.\n",
      "“There are limits to what people put into pensions. Some people don’t trust them because the rules change so often,” said Bob.\n",
      "“While it is very tax efficient to make use of pensions, there are other options available. You could be saving up in ISAs, or trying to build up investments through open-ended investment companies (OEICs).”\n",
      "The latter are professionally managed collective investment schemes that pool your money with other investors. You effectively invest in a wider range of shares, and spread the risk across different investments.\n",
      "“Some people like to have a clear objective and be very specific about which pot of money it’s going to be taken from,” adds Bob.\n",
      "A well-known example of that strategy is the man who plans to buy a boat on the day he retires - the basis of the Deacon Blue pop hit, Dignity.\n",
      "“Perhaps that guy was putting his earnings into one specific place, like a piggy bank under the bed,” explains Bob. “Other people may put £70 a month into a savings plan for the next 10 years because they've worked out that's what it will take to achieve their dream.\"\n",
      "The wealth management expert also says you shouldn’t rule out stock market investment.\n",
      "“When you save on a monthly basis the stock market risks are smoothed because of the concept of pound-cost averaging,\" he says.\n",
      "“If you save month by month, you’re making lots of little investments, whether prices are up, down or indifferent. When prices go up, you don’t get as much for your money, but when they go down, you actually buy a greater number of units, or shares, and over time it generally smooths out.”\n"

      "Firstly, Doddie was a very, very good rugby player. People forget that because they see him as a larger than life, fun character. He likes to talk down his rugby achievements. Doing after-dinner speeches he’ll say he lost so many games for Scotland and he makes it sound as if he wasn’t a great player. In fact, he was the first modern second-row player in the northern hemisphere. \n",
      "When I was at school and he was coming into the Scotland team, there was Ian Jones in New Zealand, changing the position from big lumps who would scrum and maul to players who could leap in the lineout but also play rugby. Doddie was our Ian Jones. He got into the Scotland team at an early age and then got into the 1997 Lions squad and was up against some very good players. He was on his way to playing Test rugby for the Lions until that horrendous karate kick and that knee injury which ended his tour.\n",
      "He played in some great Scotland teams but also won the English Premiership with Newcastle. Doddie was first and foremost an excellent player, but also fun to be around.\n",
      "My first Scotland tour was to Australia in 1992. Doddie had only played for Scotland for two years but it felt like he was an established player.\n",

      "Last week I was the worst dad in the world. My 11-year-old son desperately wanted me to take him to the Edinburgh derby and I’d said no.\n",
      "My boy loves football, loves goals being scored. But, being 11, he’s also intrigued by what goes on in the stands: the noise, the songs, the drumming, the flag-waving, the flares, the chanting, the counter-chanting, the jumping up and down, the humour, the bad language. I can’t be dismayed by this, having been exactly the same when I was his age.\n",
      "But something told me this game between Hearts and Hibs might be trouble. I’d taken my son to two derbies at Hearts’ Tynecastle last season and he went to a third at the stadium with his uncle when I was reporting on that game. Three times he’d been there – three more, incidentally, than some of those who’ve been pronouncing on the shocking events of last Wednesday night. Though he may not have noticed, Tynecastle grew more and more edgy with each visit. I decided we’d sit this one out and what a good decision that proved to be.\n",

Or, in the aftermath, a newspaper photograph of the “Hang Neil Lennon” graffiti, should he have cause to ask: “What does ‘hang’ mean?” Or, having read the next day’s headlines, when Lennon detailed the abuse he suffers on a regular basis, feel compelled to ask: “What’s a fenian?

Cash from the livestock market is spent at the feed mart and, like blood pumped from the heart, flows into a dozen other local businesses that keep small communities going. Tourism is the other big industry in rural Scotland, but farming arguably does more to keep families, and therefore vital services, in rural towns and villages year-round.\n",
      "Certain sections of the commentariat scoffed when the Scottish Government complained of a ‘power grab’ by the UK Government. Powers that had been held in Brussels were coming back to the UK, so the SNP had nothing to complain about, it was argued.\n",

      "America goes to the polls in the midterm elections today after a nightmare week in which the President has unleashed, even by his own standards, a visceral assault on the qualities of respect, tolerance and justice that are necessary to support a reasonable level of civility and informed political discourse in any modern country. This has been an ugly week for America.\n",

      "Trump’s campaign is racially charged and anti-immigration, deliberately raising the fear of a non-White America. Maybe, for the first time since 2016, Trump’s narcissism and his own deep insecurity and fear are defining his closing argument. As a result, he has imprinted his own uniquely toxic brand of anger, hate and racism on the final days of the campaign. This may be a step too far for much of America. But do Democrats continue to underestimate Trump’s political strategy and the cultural wars that are tearing the US apart? \n",

      "The First World War changed art, as it changed so much in the world. There was no shortage of artists, in the decades after 1918, grappling with the implications of loss and brutality on an unimaginable scale. More rare is art which captures these events as they were happening. At the time, the idea of an official war artist was still in its infancy, and the boundary lines between art and propaganda were awkwardly blurred. Those caught drawing or painting in the trenches without authorisation could have stood accused of spying.\n",
      "However, many serving soldiers did depict their experience, as Brushes with War, an extensive exhibition at Kelvingrove, shows. The majority of these 219 works come from a single collection, that of American Joel Parkinson, who runs the World War History & Art Museum in Alliance, north-west Ohio. This is supplemented by small groups of works from Glasgow Museums’ collection by Fred Farrell – who was invalided out of the Army in 1916 and managed to get himself appointed Glasgow’s official war artist – and Percy Smith, an artist-soldier who produced drypoints in the trenches and created a powerful series of prints, Dances of Death, in 1919.\n",

      "Musical man of parts Damon Albarn has just wrapped up a US tour with Gorillaz, his fluid collaboration with illustrator Jamie Hewlett and whoever the hell he fancies inviting into the studio (George Benson and Snoop Dogg, most recently). But there is no rest for the prolific, as he prepares to launch himself back into one of his other bands – the previously unnamed quartet comprising ex-Clash bassist Paul Simonon, former Verve guitarist Simon Tong and veteran Fela Kuti drummer Tony Allen, who were first spotted around 2007 touting a haunting concept album called The Good, The Bad & The Queen. For practical purposes, Albarn now accepts that this is also the name of the group. “We’re still in the reign of dear Elizabeth,” he notes drily.\n",
      "Quite how he manages to carve any time out of his schedule for interviews is a wonder, but Albarn is in relaxed and ruminative mood, content to muse on the fictional kingdom he and his GBQ compadres have created for their newly announced second album, Merrie Land, inspired by Brexit and the bright lights of Blackpool, as he sits on a balcony in Los Angeles.\n",
      "“A lot of this record was done looking out of windows,” he says. “We rented a corner window studio in one of the dancehalls up near where the Blackpool Tower is, so we had this wonderful open space with lots of light, and you could see part of the Tower from the window and when the westerly wind was coming in, all the seagulls would line up and just float in the air.”\n",
      "Albarn is a thoughtful songwriter at the best of times and The Good, The Bad & The Queen has already proved a valuable vehicle for his poignant strain of English melancholia, shot through with Simonon’s dub vibrations and Allen’s Afrobeat charms. The self-titled debut was a love letter to Albarn’s native London and the group were poised to follow up with an album of material good to go in 2014. But that was before certain constitutional events overtook them and a lyrical rethink was required.\n",
      "“Paul has a relationship with a more political music in a different political time, and Tony’s involvement with Fela Kuti … they established their own state within the state of Nigeria,” says Albarn. “So in a sense those two musicians have a cumulative energy about them which informs the world that we inhabit when we’re in the band. In many ways it recalibrates my whole sense of who I am when I’m with them, and on this occasion it inspired us all to try and create a kaleidoscopic moment in an imaginary place called Merrie Land. I think. But I might be talking Californian nonsense…”\n",

      "Book review: Scotland - Her Story, by Rosemary Goring\n",
      "The subtitle of this splendid book is “The Nation’s History By The Women Who Lived It.” The key word there is of course “lived.” While it all depends on what you mean by “history,” Rosemary Goring is far too scrupulous an editor and anthologist to have preferred the word “made” to “lived.” One couldn’t however complain if she had chosen to say “endured” rather than “lived.” Though there are plenty of remarkable and strong-minded women featured here, such as the 18th century “virago” Lady Bridekirk who “was famous, even in the Annandale border, both at the bowl and in battle” and “could drink a Scots pint of brandy with ease” (a Scots pint being three imperial pints), it’s still the case that till very recently women took second place in history. Indeed, so long as the history taught in schools and universities was political, constitutional, military and ecclesiastical, women rarely played a prominent part. History was something that happened to them.\n",
      "So, embarrassingly, when 30 years ago I wrote a book entitled 101 Great Scots I was sadly aware how poorly women were represented. Magnus Linklater had had the same experience when editing a collection of 100 Scottish obituaries from the Times. Consequently, as Rosemary Goring writes in her admirable introduction, the exclusion of women – and children – means that “far more than half of Scotland’s history has been forever lost.” At the very least she has redressed the balance.\n",
      "There were of course exceptions, mostly royal or noble, notably Mary Queen of Scots. Goring gives us enough to follow her tragic story – the first item in the book is the moving and dignified letter she wrote to her brother-in-law, the French king Henri III, on the night before her execution. Though Mary’s time in Scotland was brief, and though her influence on the country’s history might be considered insignificant, she remains the best-known of Scottish women, and Goring recognizes this.\n",
      "The book’s early material deals mostly with queens and noblewomen, such as the Countess of Buchan who crowned Robert the Bruce, was captured by the English and held prisoner in a cage hung from the battlements of Berwick Castle and “Black Agnes “ who successfully defended Dunbar Castle against the English. “Her memory survives and “some say they have seen her walking the castle ruins – although,” Goring adds, “this part of town does have an abundance of pubs.”\n",
      "The material becomes richer and more varied from the 16th century onwards; a pension for John Knox’s widow, witchcraft and witch-burnings, Covenanting martyrs, household accounts, advice on choosing a wife, rape in the Highlands, regulations for midwives and the Aberdeen Kirk Session’s investigation of fornications. We have Flora MacDonald’s account of her role in saving Charles Edward and advice on how to kill time while men drink and gamble. Jean Armour remembers Burns at table – he didn’t like puddings – so much for the race’s chieftain, haggis. We get a “Testimony of coal workers” from 1840 and Jane Welsh Carlyle’s view of marriage and “servant trouble”. There’s a “Parochial Board Sub-Committee’s Report on Orphans in the Snow,” and observations on the Spanish Civil War by the “Red” Duchess of Atholl jostle with “Fish Gutters” and “Teashops.” There is comedy – Mary Contini’s “An Italian Scottish Wedding” – and tragedy, memories of “Dunblane’s Darkest Day.” We have Winnie Ewing’s experience of being “stalked” by a Labour MP in Westminster, and, finally, a chapter entitled “First Among Equals: Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister.”\n"

      "Teenage Fanclub: The Creation Years 1991-93, Barrowland, Glasgow ****\n",
      "FOR nearly 30 years, Bellshill’s Teenage Fanclub have been a comforting presence in Scottish music, a band whose lack of sonic ostentation is balanced by the gorgeous, pinpoint pop accuracy of their most beautiful songs. They don’t shout loudly, but their heart and soul come through with perfect clarity, and the two major events which have brought them firmly back into the public consciousness this autumn have been seismic by their standards.\n",
      "The first was the announcement of the departure of founder bassist Gerard Love (although not just yet) on the grounds of his unease about the prospect of travelling by jet for upcoming tour dates in the southern hemisphere; the other was the band’s novel and well-received decision to not just revisit one classic album in a live touring context, as many acts now do, but to play each of their albums from the 1990s consecutively over three nights.\n",
      "This first show showcased 1991’s Bandwagonesque, the band’s first album proper for the Creation label, and 1993’s often critically snubbed follow-up, Thirteen. The current five-piece line-up was joined by original drummer Brendan O’Hare, a grey-bearded mine of well-received stage banter, his successor Paul Quinn on percussion and sometime multi-instrumentalist Joe McAlinden.\n",

Beginning in the aftermath of Waterloo with a traumatised member of Wellington’s army stumbling around in a stupor, the film follows this soldier’s return to Manchester where his shattered psyche is reflected in the shattered lives of his mother (Maxine Peake) and the rest of his family, who have been plunged into poverty and hunger by austerity measures imposed on working class communities across the north of England by an unrepresentative political system.\n"
