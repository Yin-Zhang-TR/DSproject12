Sorry, we're having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we can Waiting for Video... Celtic could rekindle their interest in previous target Milad Mohammadi, after Daniel Arzani’s season-ending injury.  The Australian teenager came on for his debut as a second half substitute in the Hoops’ 5-0 win over Dundee last week but was stretchered off just twenty minutes later, having gone down awkwardly while trying to change direction. Scans have shown he requires an operation to rebuild a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament.
Up to tour members if they want to play in Saudi, insists Keith Pelley

Of the 48 tournaments on the newly-announced 2019 European Tour schedule, one sticks out like a sore thumb. The inaugural Saudi International had already raised eyebrows when it was floated earlier in the year and is now firmly in focus due to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi  Arabia consulate in Istanbul last month and the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. It probably wasn’t fair for Padraig Harrington, the man who will almost certainly be Europe’s 2020 Ryder Cup captain, to be put on the spot during last week’s Turkish Airlines Open last week, but it was certainly a topic that Keith Pelley, the European Tour chief executive, needed to talk about, and he did so during a visit to the Regnum Carya resort in Belek. “I can simply say the Saudi International is on our schedule and, with the Ras Al Khalmah Challenge Tour Grand Final also taking place this week in the UAE and with the DP World Championship coming up, the region is very important  to the European Tour,” said the Canadian.  “We have heard some of the criticism of the region, we have listened and will continue to monitor the situation. We have had no dialogue with our partners, our own government, the golf federation or anyone from Saudi Arabia.” On hearing that, you would think the European Tour membership would be urging Pelley to at least open some dialogue with them on the matter. This has not been the case so far. 
Aidan Smith: We all wanted to be Fijian after thrilling 1970 tour

The first day at high school was daunting. All those subjects, a different teacher for each and I got lost on the way to physics and again coming out of Latin where we were taught that our motto, “Fortiter et recte”, meant “Bravely and uprightly”. I wasn’t feeling that, not at all. But the second day after a glance at the timetable looked like more fun: double PE immediately following lunch, wiping out the rest of the afternoon. “Where are the balls, sir?” I asked the games master we’d come to call Hammy, though never to his face. “Right there, you buffoon,” he said. “But they’re rugby balls, Sir. We mean the footballs.” “This is Broughton, laddie. We don’t play soccer here and over my dead body will we ever. Now, you look like a middle row to me … ” I’d never played rugby before – none of us had. And those first few games against other Edinburgh schools were hellish. We were sensitive middle-class boys. Few of us had ever been in a fight. We were the original snowflakes.

Gregor Townsend: ‘People forget what an excellent player Doddie Weir was’

https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/scotland/gregor-townsend-people-forget-what-an-excellent-player-doddie-weir-was-1-4822658
Speaking at yesterday’s squad announcement press conference at BT Murrayfield, Gregor Townsend spoke at length about his former team-mate and friend, Doddie Weir, his fight against MND and his inspiring work to raise funds for MND research. Firstly, Doddie was a very, very good rugby player. People forget that because they see him as a larger than life, fun character. He likes to talk down his rugby achievements. Doing after-dinner speeches he’ll say he lost so many games for Scotland and he makes it sound as if he wasn’t a great player. In fact, he was the first modern second-row player in the northern hemisphere.  When I was at school and he was coming into the Scotland team, there was Ian Jones in New Zealand, changing the position from big lumps who would scrum and maul to players who could leap in the lineout but also play rugby. Doddie was our Ian Jones. He got into the Scotland team at an early age and then got into the 1997 Lions squad and was up against some very good players. He was on his way to playing Test rugby for the Lions until that horrendous karate kick and that knee injury which ended his tour. He played in some great Scotland teams but also won the English Premiership with Newcastle. Doddie was first and foremost an excellent player, but also fun to be around. My first Scotland tour was to Australia in 1992. Doddie had only played for Scotland for two years but it felt like he was an established player.
A Hibs-Hearts game is no place for my 11-year-old son – Aidan Smith

Children shouldn’t find themselves asking ‘What’s a fenian?’ or ‘What’s the Ku Klux Klan?’ after watching a football match, writes Aidan Smith, following the Hibs-Hearts game last week. Last week I was the worst dad in the world. My 11-year-old son desperately wanted me to take him to the Edinburgh derby and I’d said no. My boy loves football, loves goals being scored. But, being 11, he’s also intrigued by what goes on in the stands: the noise, the songs, the drumming, the flag-waving, the flares, the chanting, the counter-chanting, the jumping up and down, the humour, the bad language. I can’t be dismayed by this, having been exactly the same when I was his age. But something told me this game between Hearts and Hibs might be trouble. I’d taken my son to two derbies at Hearts’ Tynecastle last season and he went to a third at the stadium with his uncle when I was reporting on that game. Three times he’d been there – three more, incidentally, than some of those who’ve been pronouncing on the shocking events of last Wednesday night. Though he may not have noticed, Tynecastle grew more and more edgy with each visit. I decided we’d sit this one out and what a good decision that proved to be. No 11-year-old needs to see a goalkeeper being attacked by a fan. Or a manager slump to the ground having been hit by a coin. Or, in the aftermath, a newspaper photograph of the “Hang Neil Lennon” graffiti, should he have cause to ask: “What does ‘hang’ mean?” Or, having read the next day’s headlines, when Lennon detailed the abuse he suffers on a regular basis, feel compelled to ask: “What’s a fenian? What’s a tarrier? What’s the Ku Klux Klan?”
How Brexit could spark new Highland Clearances – Paris Gourtsoyannis

Farmers and crofters are warning that a row over subsidies in post-Brexit Britain threatens rural life in Scotland, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis. Farmers, by and large, are a stoic bunch. So when a panel of Scottish farming and crofting leaders came to Westminster last week to warn that much of their way of life could be lost, you’d imagine people would sit up and listen. The other thing farmers are known for is spending their money. It doesn’t sit long in their pockets. Cash from the livestock market is spent at the feed mart and, like blood pumped from the heart, flows into a dozen other local businesses that keep small communities going. Tourism is the other big industry in rural Scotland, but farming arguably does more to keep families, and therefore vital services, in rural towns and villages year-round. Certain sections of the commentariat scoffed when the Scottish Government complained of a ‘power grab’ by the UK Government. Powers that had been held in Brussels were coming back to the UK, so the SNP had nothing to complain about, it was argued. Except it isn’t just the SNP complaining – it’s farmers, not normally given to nationalist hysteria and grievance. 
Midterms: Voters should heed words of past presidents – Henry McLeish
Published: 06:00 Tuesday 06 November 2018
https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/midterms-voters-should-heed-words-of-past-presidents-henry-mcleish-1-4824700
America goes to the polls in the midterm elections today after a nightmare week in which the President has unleashed, even by his own standards, a visceral assault on the qualities of respect, tolerance and justice that are necessary to support a reasonable level of civility and informed political discourse in any modern country. This has been an ugly week for America. Disappointed by his loss of momentum, angered by other serious issues hogging the limelight and dominating the news to his exclusion – such as the worst massacre of Jews ever in the US – and panicked by the prospect of his base not having enough raw red meat, Trump has drawn upon all of his worst traits of nationalism, authoritarianism and nativism. Trump’s campaign is racially charged and anti-immigration, deliberately raising the fear of a non-White America. Maybe, for the first time since 2016, Trump’s narcissism and his own deep insecurity and fear are defining his closing argument. As a result, he has imprinted his own uniquely toxic brand of anger, hate and racism on the final days of the campaign. This may be a step too far for much of America. But do Democrats continue to underestimate Trump’s political strategy and the cultural wars that are tearing the US apart?  The President is unapologetic. He believes the US is at war with migrants and he seems keen to deploy the full military might of the US on the Mexican border: and even after the synagogue massacre he gave credence to claims by the far-right that Jews are organising and financing the migrant caravans by suggesting liberal billionaire George Soros was behind the current one! These are seriously deranged utterances. There are few words to explain this political stunt and the lies on which it is based. Sadly, both the Republican party and the presidency are increasingly defined by lies.

Today, as the US holds its midterm elections, voters will cast judgement on one of the most divisive Presidents in US history – Donald J Trump. But ahead of midterm elections, which could tie the hands of Donald Trump or embolden him further, the ‘mainstream media’ gave its verdict.  “Midterms test whether Republicans not named Trump can win by stoking racial animosity,” was the headline on The Washington Post’s website. The New York Times’ main headline online was: “Trump Closes Out a Campaign Built on Fear, Anger and Division.”  READ MORE: Leader comment: A denunciation of Donald Trump CNN refused to show an anti-immigration advert approved by Trump, saying it had made it “abundantly clear in its editorial coverage that this ad is racist”; NBC News ran the ad but then decided to stop doing so because of its “insensitive nature”.
Art reviews: Brushes With War | Christine Borland - I Say Nothing

Work from soldiers in the trenches gives a unique window into the experiences of those on the front line in the First World War Brushes with War: Art from the Front Line 14-18, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow *** Christine Borland: I Say Nothing, Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow *** The First World War changed art, as it changed so much in the world. There was no shortage of artists, in the decades after 1918, grappling with the implications of loss and brutality on an unimaginable scale. More rare is art which captures these events as they were happening. At the time, the idea of an official war artist was still in its infancy, and the boundary lines between art and propaganda were awkwardly blurred. Those caught drawing or painting in the trenches without authorisation could have stood accused of spying. However, many serving soldiers did depict their experience, as Brushes with War, an extensive exhibition at Kelvingrove, shows. The majority of these 219 works come from a single collection, that of American Joel Parkinson, who runs the World War History & Art Museum in Alliance, north-west Ohio. This is supplemented by small groups of works from Glasgow Museums’ collection by Fred Farrell – who was invalided out of the Army in 1916 and managed to get himself appointed Glasgow’s official war artist – and Percy Smith, an artist-soldier who produced drypoints in the trenches and created a powerful series of prints, Dances of Death, in 1919.
Damon Albarn on Blackpool, Brexit and the art of making Merrie

https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/music/damon-albarn-on-blackpool-brexit-and-the-art-of-making-merrie-1-4820805
Musical man of parts Damon Albarn has just wrapped up a US tour with Gorillaz, his fluid collaboration with illustrator Jamie Hewlett and whoever the hell he fancies inviting into the studio (George Benson and Snoop Dogg, most recently). But there is no rest for the prolific, as he prepares to launch himself back into one of his other bands – the previously unnamed quartet comprising ex-Clash bassist Paul Simonon, former Verve guitarist Simon Tong and veteran Fela Kuti drummer Tony Allen, who were first spotted around 2007 touting a haunting concept album called The Good, The Bad & The Queen. For practical purposes, Albarn now accepts that this is also the name of the group. “We’re still in the reign of dear Elizabeth,” he notes drily. Quite how he manages to carve any time out of his schedule for interviews is a wonder, but Albarn is in relaxed and ruminative mood, content to muse on the fictional kingdom he and his GBQ compadres have created for their newly announced second album, Merrie Land, inspired by Brexit and the bright lights of Blackpool, as he sits on a balcony in Los Angeles. “A lot of this record was done looking out of windows,” he says. “We rented a corner window studio in one of the dancehalls up near where the Blackpool Tower is, so we had this wonderful open space with lots of light, and you could see part of the Tower from the window and when the westerly wind was coming in, all the seagulls would line up and just float in the air.” Albarn is a thoughtful songwriter at the best of times and The Good, The Bad & The Queen has already proved a valuable vehicle for his poignant strain of English melancholia, shot through with Simonon’s dub vibrations and Allen’s Afrobeat charms. The self-titled debut was a love letter to Albarn’s native London and the group were poised to follow up with an album of material good to go in 2014. But that was before certain constitutional events overtook them and a lyrical rethink was required. “Paul has a relationship with a more political music in a different political time, and Tony’s involvement with Fela Kuti … they established their own state within the state of Nigeria,” says Albarn. “So in a sense those two musicians have a cumulative energy about them which informs the world that we inhabit when we’re in the band. In many ways it recalibrates my whole sense of who I am when I’m with them, and on this occasion it inspired us all to try and create a kaleidoscopic moment in an imaginary place called Merrie Land. I think. But I might be talking Californian nonsense…”
Book review: Scotland - Her Story, by Rosemary Goring
Published: 10:43 Wednesday 31 October 2018
https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/books/book-review-scotland-her-story-by-rosemary-goring-1-4822240
The subtitle of this splendid book is “The Nation’s History By The Women Who Lived It.” The key word there is of course “lived.” While it all depends on what you mean by “history,” Rosemary Goring is far too scrupulous an editor and anthologist to have preferred the word “made” to “lived.” One couldn’t however complain if she had chosen to say “endured” rather than “lived.” Though there are plenty of remarkable and strong-minded women featured here, such as the 18th century “virago” Lady Bridekirk who “was famous, even in the Annandale border, both at the bowl and in battle” and “could drink a Scots pint of brandy with ease” (a Scots pint being three imperial pints), it’s still the case that till very recently women took second place in history. Indeed, so long as the history taught in schools and universities was political, constitutional, military and ecclesiastical, women rarely played a prominent part. History was something that happened to them. So, embarrassingly, when 30 years ago I wrote a book entitled 101 Great Scots I was sadly aware how poorly women were represented. Magnus Linklater had had the same experience when editing a collection of 100 Scottish obituaries from the Times. Consequently, as Rosemary Goring writes in her admirable introduction, the exclusion of women – and children – means that “far more than half of Scotland’s history has been forever lost.” At the very least she has redressed the balance. There were of course exceptions, mostly royal or noble, notably Mary Queen of Scots. Goring gives us enough to follow her tragic story – the first item in the book is the moving and dignified letter she wrote to her brother-in-law, the French king Henri III, on the night before her execution. Though Mary’s time in Scotland was brief, and though her influence on the country’s history might be considered insignificant, she remains the best-known of Scottish women, and Goring recognizes this. The book’s early material deals mostly with queens and noblewomen, such as the Countess of Buchan who crowned Robert the Bruce, was captured by the English and held prisoner in a cage hung from the battlements of Berwick Castle and “Black Agnes “ who successfully defended Dunbar Castle against the English. “Her memory survives and “some say they have seen her walking the castle ruins – although,” Goring adds, “this part of town does have an abundance of pubs.” The material becomes richer and more varied from the 16th century onwards; a pension for John Knox’s widow, witchcraft and witch-burnings, Covenanting martyrs, household accounts, advice on choosing a wife, rape in the Highlands, regulations for midwives and the Aberdeen Kirk Session’s investigation of fornications. We have Flora MacDonald’s account of her role in saving Charles Edward and advice on how to kill time while men drink and gamble. Jean Armour remembers Burns at table – he didn’t like puddings – so much for the race’s chieftain, haggis. We get a “Testimony of coal workers” from 1840 and Jane Welsh Carlyle’s view of marriage and “servant trouble”. There’s a “Parochial Board Sub-Committee’s Report on Orphans in the Snow,” and observations on the Spanish Civil War by the “Red” Duchess of Atholl jostle with “Fish Gutters” and “Teashops.” There is comedy – Mary Contini’s “An Italian Scottish Wedding” – and tragedy, memories of “Dunblane’s Darkest Day.” We have Winnie Ewing’s experience of being “stalked” by a Labour MP in Westminster, and, finally, a chapter entitled “First Among Equals: Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister.”
Music review: Teenage Fanclub - The Creation Years, Barrowland, Glasgow

This week Teenage Fanclub played three shows in Glasgow, each one focussing on different albums released during the band’s decade with Creation Records. Fiona Shepherd and David Pollock were there...  Teenage Fanclub: The Creation Years 1991-93, Barrowland, Glasgow **** FOR nearly 30 years, Bellshill’s Teenage Fanclub have been a comforting presence in Scottish music, a band whose lack of sonic ostentation is balanced by the gorgeous, pinpoint pop accuracy of their most beautiful songs. They don’t shout loudly, but their heart and soul come through with perfect clarity, and the two major events which have brought them firmly back into the public consciousness this autumn have been seismic by their standards. The first was the announcement of the departure of founder bassist Gerard Love (although not just yet) on the grounds of his unease about the prospect of travelling by jet for upcoming tour dates in the southern hemisphere; the other was the band’s novel and well-received decision to not just revisit one classic album in a live touring context, as many acts now do, but to play each of their albums from the 1990s consecutively over three nights. This first show showcased 1991’s Bandwagonesque, the band’s first album proper for the Creation label, and 1993’s often critically snubbed follow-up, Thirteen. The current five-piece line-up was joined by original drummer Brendan O’Hare, a grey-bearded mine of well-received stage banter, his successor Paul Quinn on percussion and sometime multi-instrumentalist Joe McAlinden.

New £1m visitor centre to tell story of Tennent’s Lager

A £1 million-plus visitor centre has been built to tell the story of “cultural icon” Tennent’s Lager. Brewery bosses hope the centre, in Glasgow’s east end, will become a popular destination for beer lovers. Meanwhile tourist chiefs in the city hope the venue, which opens next month, will help Glasgow meet its goal of attracting one million extra visitors a year by 2023. Tourists spend about £1 billion a year on food and drink while visiting Scotland. Tennent’s bosses say the visitor centre at its Wellpark Brewery will tell the history of brewing in the area from the 1500s through to the present day, including how founder Hugh Tennent first brewed the lager that bears his name in 1885.

Family-owned manufacturer Castle Precision Engineering has landed a record aerospace order with Rolls-Royce, as it targets annual revenues of £25 million. The Glasgow-based firm, which was founded in 1951 and is still run by the Tiefenbrun family, has secured a contract with the global aerospace engineer valued at £80m on a six-year programme, the largest order in Castle’s history. It comes as the company announced it is forecasting an increase in sales from £15m in 2016 to £25m by next year. The new agreement continues a 35-year relationship between the two firms, and will see Castle supply Rolls-Royce with compressor cones, shafts, spacers, and turbine seal plates for the Trent family of aero-engines. Castle, which employs some 120 people, manufactures high precision critical gas turbine components for the aerospace industry, as well as complex prismatic parts for the defence industry.

Why are so many landmark historic buildings lost to fire?

It was a landmark property occupying a prime city centre location until a devastating fire reduced it to little more than its sandstone facade. Recent events in Belfast, which saw the historic Bank Buildings go up in flames, bore more than a resemblance to the blaze which gutted the Mackintosh building at Glasgow School of Art in June. The intensity of the fire, the shocked public reaction, and a safety cordon erected around the charred remains. Now fire experts at a Scottish university have pointed to the “uncanny similarities” between the blazes in Glasgow, Belfast, and at the former Littlewoods building in Liverpool which was damaged last week. In each case, heritage properties under refurbishment - or due to be redeveloped - suffered catastrophic damage sufficient to lead to doubt about the ability to save and preserve them.

Hearts and Hibs have been charged by the Scottish FA for the second-half flare-up in the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle on October 31.  Players from both sides confronted each other following a challenge by Hibs striker Florian Kamberi on Hearts midfielder Oliver Bozanic during the Ladbrokes Premiership game that ended 0-0.  Kamberi, who had already been booked, was shown a second yellow card and was sent off.  Both sides are accused of breaching Disciplinary Rule 204: “Where three or more players and/or members of Team Staff from one team are involved in a confrontation with opposing players and/or members of Team Staff of the opposing team during and/or directly after a match.”  Hearts and Hibs have until Monday to respond to the charge which carries a maximum fine of £10,000. A principal hearing date has been set for November 15.

Clubs in Glasgow will be allowed to stay open until 4am - after new proposals from the city’s licensing board were approved. The new rules will allow clubs to apply for an hour-extension to the current 3am closing time of most venues in the city. It will be trialled for a year in nightclubs before the City Council considers rolling it out to late night pubs. Venues would be considered for the later hours if the licence holder can prove they have prioritised public safety, securing gold status. City licensing chiefs hope longer opening hours could further boost the city’s night-time economy, which already generates £2.6billion annually and supports some 16,600 jobs.

There was a flurry of excitement amongst senior SNP figures when a new survey reportedly showed an uptick in support for independence following Brexit, writes Murdo Fraser. Amongst those caught up in the euphoria was the SNP’s head of communications, a senior strategist and their Deputy Leader, Keith Brown. Even Nicola Sturgeon felt heartened enough to retweet the supposed “findings” of this poll. However, before breaking out the bubbly and a fresh batch of Yes2 stickers, the SNP would have done well to analyse what the poll – commissioned by Channel 4 news from Survation – actually said. The Survation poll didn’t ask respondents about how they would vote in a second independence referendum, but instead asked how Brexit would affect their vote – whether they were more or less likely to support independence. These are two completely different things. READ MORE: SNP claim Brexit ‘chaos’ will result in Scottish independence majority

Sorry, we're having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we can Waiting for Video... A FAMILY say they have been “completely failed” by their local authority after being forced to change their daughters’ school over a harrowing five-year campaign of bullying by another student – because social services prevented them removing the child from the class. Daisy Showler, nine, was subjected to vile death threats, mental and physical abuse by a fellow pupil at Stobhill Primary in Gorebridge, leaving her “frightened and anxious” to attend school. But when mum Lynsey, 38, raised concerns with local  education services, she was told the school was unable to take the pupil out of the class due to the involvement of social workers in her home life.

The tyre manufacturer, Michelin, has been accused of “betrayal” after announcing plans to close its factory in Dundee, just 18 months after receiving £4.5m in public funding to safeguard its future.  Some 845 people are employed at the plant, which has been a presence in the city since 1971.  The French firm said that despite efforts to make the factory “economically sustainable,” it was now considered “unsuitable,” with the prospect of its conversion not “financially viable.”  However, unions described the closure as a “hammer blow” and “devastating,” and pledged to fight “tooth and nail” to save the factory. The impending closure of the plant, which manufactures 16 inch and smaller tyres for cars, is likely to spark a political row.

Embattled fashion retailer New Look could close as many as 100 UK stores as part of a radical turnaround plan to cut costs and improve profitability. This includes the 60 stores marked for closure under a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) approved in March. Executive chairman Alistair McGeorge said on Tuesday that the number which will definitely close after negotiations with landlords is at 85. Discussions are ongoing regarding a further 13 stores, of which Mr McGeorge said around half were likely to close. The company’s new strategy has so far yielded higher profits, but sales continue to decline.

Ryan Christie, Steven Fletcher and Matt Phillips have been handed Scotland recalls as Alex McLeish looks to solve his striking crisis ahead of this month’s crucial UEFA Nations League matches against Albania and Israel. Injuries to Celtic hitman Leigh Griffiths and Hearts attacker Steven Naismith have left the national team boss short on options up top. Now McLeish has turned to on-form Celtic playmaker Christie, Sheffield Wednesday striker Fletcher and West Brom forward Phillips as he looks for the firepower that will keep Scotland’s hopes of topping Group C1 alive. Uility man Callum Paterson is also back in McLeish’s set-up up following his impressive recent displays for Cardiff while Michael Devlin - a late call-up ahead of last month’s friendly defeat to Portugal - is back in as cover for injured Hearts defender John Souttar. Aberdeen winger Gary MacKay-Steven was another drafted in midway through last month’s international break and also retains his place.

Anand said: “It has been a great privilege to lead Greene King for nearly 14 years and to serve as a director for 18 years. With a strong team and business culture firmly in place, the time is now right for me to hand over the baton.” Anand joined the group in 2001 as a board director and managing director of the brewing division.

Motor industry leaders have called for government policies that “encourage rather than confuse” after a further fall in car sales. New figures show that overall UK registrations reversed 2.9 per cent last month to about 153,600 vehicles, compared with 158,200 in October 2017. Registrations are down 7.2 per cent this year compared with the first ten months of last year, according to the latest data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). Sales of diesels suffered another mauling last month, tumbling 21.3 per cent, year-on-year. The SMMT said there had been a shortage of some car brands caused by backlogs at testing centres, amid tougher emissions regulations introduced in the European Union.

Utility giant ScottishPower has joined forces with Scotland’s biggest private company to offer drivers what it describes as a “hassle-free” switch to electric motoring. The electricity supplier and motor dealer Arnold Clark have taken the wraps off what is thought to be the UK’s first package of its kind for consumers considering buying or leasing an electric vehicle. The deal allows customers to book a home charging point installation and sign up to a 100 per cent renewable electricity tariff. They will receive the UK’s smallest fast charging point and be able to schedule their charging using a smartphone app to take advantage of cheaper unit rates at off-peak times. ScottishPower recently struck an agreement to sell the last of its remaining gas plants to Drax. Following the deal, ScottishPower will generate 100 per cent of electricity with wind power. Chief executive Keith Anderson said: “We’re accelerating the switch to electric vehicles by giving customers everything they need to make the change hassle-free through our new end-to-end electric vehicle package and partnership with Arnold Clark.

After several decades of gainful employment, you have every right to expect a long and happy retirement. Financial decisions you make now could go a long way to ensuring you enjoy your golden years to full effect. Building a savings and investment portfolio ahead of the day you retire means that your pension could be the last source of income you have to touch. If you are to achieve your savings goals and ambitions, it’s always better to start planning now rather than later. “The hardest thing for many people is having clearly defined objectives,” explains Edinburgh-based wealth manager Bob Hair, who heads up the Cazenove Capital office in the city.

Film reviews: Peterloo | Nae Pasaran | Mirai

Mike Leigh’s unflinching examination of the Peterloo massacre is big on historical detail but woefully short of engaging characters Peterloo (15) ** Nae Pasaran (12A) **** Mirai (PG) **** Full of noble intent and unflinching horror, Mike Leigh’s new film Peterloo dramatises the titular 1819 massacre at St Peter’s Fields, Manchester, with a forensic attention to historical detail and a frustratingly simplistic approach to characterisation. The result is a rather stultifying historical epic, a textbook example of preaching to the converted (with the emphasis on textbook). Beginning in the aftermath of Waterloo with a traumatised member of Wellington’s army stumbling around in a stupor, the film follows this soldier’s return to Manchester where his shattered psyche is reflected in the shattered lives of his mother (Maxine Peake) and the rest of his family, who have been plunged into poverty and hunger by austerity measures imposed on working class communities across the north of England by an unrepresentative political system.
