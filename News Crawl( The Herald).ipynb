      "  THE United States goes to the polls today with thoughts of a second American civil war in voters’ minds. These aren’t the paranoid fantasies of liberals driven mad by Donald Trump in the White House, these are the fears of conservative scholars like Victor Davis Hanson of Stanford University’s Hoover Institute – a man who voted twice for George W Bush. Writing in the conservative National Review, Professor Hanson said that the US had”‘arrived at the brink of a veritable civil war”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Whether we all take a deep breath, and understand our present dangerous trajectory, will determine whether 2019 becomes 1861,” he wrote. By 1865, after four years of fighting, the civil war had claimed more American lives than any other conflict before or since.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The echoes of the civil war are everywhere. As Mr Trump ordered American troops to the US-Mexico border to deal with a “caravan” of impoverished men, women and children from Honduras, seeking a new life in America, the President turned his ire on the 14th amendment of the constitution which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the States. Written in the aftermath of the civil war, it was expressly conceived to give equal protection under the law to former slaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Mr Trump is putting a crowbar into a fault-line in American life, and wrenching it open – playing to those who see “citizenship” and “white” as the same thing. The dog whistle of the 14th amendment is as alluring to a white supremacist as the word “globalist” is to an anti-Semite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Civil conflict, though, isn’t the only dread haunting American voters as they cast their ballot in today’s crucial midterm elections – there is talk in the US every week of a slow-moving coup, of the rise of fascism, of a country so sundered it can never be put back together again. Yesterday, the great American novelist Don DeLillo said he doubted his country could recover from the Trump presidency. The truth is: America is already in a state of cold war with itself.\n",

      "  Thank goodness for Tracey Crouch, then, the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford who resigned as sports minister last week in protest at what she said was an “unjustifiable” delay to a policy aimed at tackling the scourge of problem gambling. Having long campaigned for the maximum bet that can be placed via bookie-shop slot machines to be reduced from £100 to £2, Ms Crouch said she was taking a stand after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the change will be introduced in October next year and not April as she had been expecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The effects of this, she said, will be profound, with £1.6 billion expected to be lost on these machines between May 2018, when the reduction was agreed, and October 2019, when it will now take effect. Worse still, she wrote in her resignation letter, “a significant amount” of the total will be lost “in our most deprived areas”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It is no secret that gambling and hardship go hand in hand, with the Scottish Government as long ago as 2006 issuing a report that found that “disadvantaged social groups who experience poverty, unemployment, dependence on welfare, and low levels of education and household income are most likely to suffer the adverse consequences of increased gambling”. The clustering of betting shops in areas of deprivation such as Glasgow’s Dumbarton Road has long been a cause for concern and that report, which was written by University of Glasgow professor Gerda Reith, whose research focuses on problematic forms of consumption, also found that “availability and convenience are strongly associated with problem gambling”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Having been introduced after then Chancellor Gordon Brown abolished betting duties in 2001, the so-called fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) Ms Crouch has resigned over were still in their infancy when Professor Reith’s report was issued. In the years since, though, they have come to represent all that is wrong with the gambling industry, not least because they enable customers to place £100 bets every 20 seconds, leading some to lose thousands in a single sitting.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  One, notable factor in each of these last three games has been the introduction of Ryan Christie to the Celtic midfield. The Inverness-born talent was no more than an afterthought in the club’s summer transfer window, yet slowly but surely he’s worked his way in to Rodgers’ plans and has grasped the recent opportunity to prove his worth in green and white with both hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Indeed, Christie has played all but one half of Celtic’s last four games and in that select period of time the 23-year-old has picked up no less than three goals and two assists. Leading many - perhaps even his manager - to wonder whether the former Aberdeen loanee does in fact have a long-term role to play at the Glasgow club.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Christie’s speed, strength and sheer determination to dart through the middle of the pitch with or without the ball has led to an inevitable comparison with Stuart Armstrong. Not only has the young Scot obviously featured in his predecessor’s natural position for Rodgers’ side, but when we consider what he brings to this Celtic team there are fair comparisons to be made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Taking Armstrong’s stats from the 2016/17 season (He was mostly injured or disinterested in 2017/18) we can see that Christie’s brief run in the Celtic team this season are not only comparable to the former midfield star’s, but at times even better.\n",

David Beckham versus Greece, Leigh Griffiths versus England (x2); it takes a special mixture of technique and temperament to deliver on a free-kick when the world seems to be watching and for Lewis Ferguson right now everything seems to be coming up roses. Aberdeen’s 19-year-old midfield wonder kid might have had more attention on him than usual when he stepped up in the dying minutes of his side’s come-from-behind 2-1 win against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Sunday but yet again he proved he was a man for the big occasion. Shrugging off the claim to Gary Mackay-Steven to steer a right foot shot into the corner of Jamie MacDonald’s net, Ferguson afterwards paid tribute to the painstaking work he does with Aberdeen coach Barry Robson after training, a man who could hit a pretty mean free kick instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Usually I fight with Niall [McGinn] for the free kicks,” said Ferguson. “But credit to Barry Robson. He stays out with me for about half an hour after training and we just practise free kicks. He was a good free-kick taker so he gives me loads of tips. It’s always me or Niall. I don’t think any of the other boys really fancy it. But I fancied that one and thankfully it went in the back of the net.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  With sources of goals in Alex McLeish’s Scotland team not quite so obvious right now with the likes of Steven Naismith and Leigh Griffiths posted missing, there was speculation yesterday as to whether Ferguson – the son of Rangers legend Derek – could even find himself fast-tracked into the full squad in time for the matches against Albania and Israel. That seems a little premature but, as he puts it himself, the big occasion certainly “doesn’t faze him”. He shrugged off the notion that the events of the week should somehow have taken anything out of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “Recovering mentally? I don’t really think much about it,” said Ferguson. “The big occasion doesn’t really faze me. The bigger the game, the bigger the occasion, I enjoy it even more. But physically it was tough. The semi-final on Sunday was a later kick-off and then we had to recover in time for the game against Hamilton. I played 90 minutes there and then 90 minutes against Kilmarnock. It’s tough on the legs but Monday is a day off and then back to work on Tuesday.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Aberdeen inched to seventh after what was a slow start to the season on the back of this scarcely-deserved 2-1 win, but the Ladbrokes Premiership is a marathon, not a sprint. After three big wins in a week, Ferguson for one sees no reason why they can’t overhaul early leaders Hearts to book a European berth. Take another three points on Friday night against Hibs and Aberdeen will suddenly be rocking.\n",

As Mr Trump ordered American troops to the US-Mexico border to deal with a “caravan” of impoverished men, women and children from Honduras, seeking a new life in America, the President turned his ire on the 14th amendment of the constitution which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the States.

It already pays eight per cent of tax revenue on interest payments; does Mr Mowbray suggest it initially spends 25 per cent of our taxes to pay down the debt and to service the loan repayments? If not, Brexit or no Brexit the UK will drag the ball and chain of debt behind it for decades while the financial sector continues to siphon off some of the taxes paid by those fortunate to be in work and I and my contemporaries pay from our pensions simply because we had the wit to use part of our already-taxed income to pay into one.\n",

A leading US manufacturer is to discontinue most of its flavoured e-cigarettes. A RAND Corporation study says that adolescents who vape are not only more likely to smoke cigarettes but are also likely to increase their use of both products eventually.

      "  PRIZE juries make their own choices. I’ve been on lots, and they’ve done some eccentric things. Still, the omission from the shortlists of our publicly funded literary awards of a singularly impactful and important Scottish book is a surprise and a headscratcher. Darren McGarvey’s Poverty Safari was first published by Edinburgh’s Luath Press, then picked up by Picador, then won the hugely prestigious Orwell Prize for political journalism. The Guardian praised its “honesty and wisdom”; the Financial Times called it “urgently written, articulate and emotional”; even the New York Times covered it. But the Saltire Awards didn’t progress it into serious contention – even though there are only four books on a Best First Book shortlist that has room for six, and even though Luath has been nominated in its Best Publisher Awards in part for its achievement in publishing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Again, prize juries make their own choices, and those don’t need to be accounted for as long as basic protocols have been followed, like the one where any jury member unable to be impartial due to personal connections to an entrant recuses him or herself from sitting in judgement of that work. The Saltire Society assures me that every book entered was judged on literary merit. And it’s true that having had such vast impact, and having represented and reached a sector of Scottish society not always visible in the literary world, didn’t guarantee Poverty Safari a place on the shortlist (although I would note that in the time I was a Saltire judge, we progressed many books on the basis that they just mattered too much to be chucked out at the first round).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  This omission still gives pause, however. It follows several years when, despite a rising profile as a rapper and commentator prior to the publication of Poverty Safari, McGarvey wasn’t named in another rundown of significant Scottish cultural figures, the List magazine’s Hot 100. (He’s out again this year, since it’s all women, though an editorial note acknowledges the book’s prominence.) It makes you wonder about tall poppy syndrome, when a work so honoured elsewhere gets junked in its homeland. And it calls to mind the current fad for “no platforming” individuals whose viewpoint affronts particular sensibilities. McGarvey, after all, has got many backs up in the past, not least by querying how feminist discourse about “male privilege” is read by men who live in serious deprivation, and how poverty intersects with violence. (He knows a bit about this through the work he’s done with the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit.) Finally, and unfortunately, it reinforces an impression held by many: that our cultural gatekeepers don’t wish to hear from the wrong side of the tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  I don’t endorse the latter idea: it’s unfair to the countless Scottish artists and arts workers who had complicated routes into their fields and who certainly aren’t subsisting on foie gras now. (Indeed, for balance, I’d say that McGarvey’s work is flawed by his tendency to portray people not in poverty as an undifferentiated blob of smug privilege.) The Saltire Awards has certainly honoured writers from various backgrounds in the past. Still, this snub should function as a reminder to keep an eye on the gradient of the playing field. “I didn’t work this damn hard/To stay where I belong,” runs a lyric by Edinburgh band Young Fathers, another success story from Scotland’s unmoneyed tiers. We who have influence in culture must be vigilant that we’re not restricting where others feel they belong – and that personal animosities don’t pollute processes that are, after all, conducted on behalf of all of Scotland.\n",

      "  IN October 1962, more than four years after suffering serious injuries in the Munich air disaster that claimed the lives of 23 people, including eight of his Manchester United players, Matt Busby arrived in Glasgow to be presented with the Glasgow Charity Cup.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Two months earlier, on August 8 (a few days, incidentally, after the death of Marilyn Monroe), Busby’s United team had beaten a Glasgow select by four goals to two at Hampden. The Glasgow side had five players each from Rangers and Celtic, and one from Partick Thistle, but it wasn’t strong enough to prevent a defeat. The Glasgow Herald’s Cyril Horne reported that United had won “after a late recovery which surprised the Glasgow Select team just as much as it did the crowd of some 82,000.” Three Scots in the Manchester side - David Herd, Ian Moir and Denis Law - did the late damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  When Busby returned in October to be presented with the cup by Lord Provost Jean Roberts, it was revealed that the match had raised a record £14,000, which would be distributed to 67 good causes organisations. The cup had been established in 1876 and had now raised a grand total of almost £320,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Mrs Roberts told Busby that she hoped that the Glasgow team would be given a chance the following year to reclaim the trophy. Busby said he knew his directors would be so pleased with the outcome of the match that he was sure that United would be back.\n",

      "  WHETHER it’s a Scottish politician praising legislation designed to curtail the reproductive rights of the poor or a Westminster front bench giving vociferous support to what are seen as poverty-inducing benefit reforms, the Tories are doing a great job of living up to their image as a nasty party whose sympathies lie only with the privileged few.\n",

      "  Thank goodness for Tracey Crouch, then, the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford who resigned as sports minister last week in protest at what she said was an “unjustifiable” delay to a policy aimed at tackling the scourge of problem gambling. Having long campaigned for the maximum bet that can be placed via bookie-shop slot machines to be reduced from £100 to £2, Ms Crouch said she was taking a stand after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the change will be introduced in October next year and not April as she had been expecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The effects of this, she said, will be profound, with £1.6 billion expected to be lost on these machines between May 2018, when the reduction was agreed, and October 2019, when it will now take effect. Worse still, she wrote in her resignation letter, “a significant amount” of the total will be lost “in our most deprived areas”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  It is no secret that gambling and hardship go hand in hand, with the Scottish Government as long ago as 2006 issuing a report that found that “disadvantaged social groups who experience poverty, unemployment, dependence on welfare, and low levels of education and household income are most likely to suffer the adverse consequences of increased gambling”. The clustering of betting shops in areas of deprivation such as Glasgow’s Dumbarton Road has long been a cause for concern and that report, which was written by University of Glasgow professor Gerda Reith, whose research focuses on problematic forms of consumption, also found that “availability and convenience are strongly associated with problem gambling”.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Having been introduced after then Chancellor Gordon Brown abolished betting duties in 2001, the so-called fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) Ms Crouch has resigned over were still in their infancy when Professor Reith’s report was issued. In the years since, though, they have come to represent all that is wrong with the gambling industry, not least because they enable customers to place £100 bets every 20 seconds, leading some to lose thousands in a single sitting.\n",

      "  A composer forgetting about a commission might sound unlikely and, indeed, even affectedly blasé.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The recording of The Four Pillars – in a switch from standard practice, Vass is going to perform the new piece and have it on sale at the concert – took place in one day less than a week following its completion and is being pressed onto CDs even as Vass speaks to your correspondent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  “It’s been quite an intense process,” says Vass, who exudes the air of a man for whom intensity could never in a million years equate to becoming flustered. “There was quite a delay while the fiddle festival waited to hear about funding, which tends to be the way of these things, and I actually started writing the music on September 25 and completed it about three weeks later.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Named for the four main tune styles in Scottish traditional music – the slow air, march, strathspey and reel – The Four Pillars features nine melodies played by some of the leading fiddle players in Scotland who have been well chosen for their specialisms. Lauren MacColl, herself a composer and a former winner of the BBC’s Young Folk award, is eminently suited to playing the slow airs with her ultra-expressive, deeply characterful style. Perthshire’s Patsy Reid will play the strathspeys and her Shetland-born namesake, Jenna Reid the reels, while Vass himself takes the marches.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  McPherson’s original idea as a young actor in 1988 was to write and perform a one-man show about Sorley’s better known contemporary, Wilfred Owen. A director told McPherson that there were lots of plays about Owen already, and that he should do one about Sorley instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  McPherson had been running the Finborough Theatre for 17 years by the time he began what would become It Is Easy To Be Dead, and programmed it as part of a season to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the war. Keen to come at things from a different angle, McPherson’s 2014 season included the English-language premiere of German playwright Rolf Hochhuth’s Summer 14 – A Dance of Death, which looked at the war from a German and European perspective.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The following year, McPherson wrote I Wish to Die Singing, a documentary drama written in response to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, when a million and a half people were killed in what was then the Turkish city of Constantinople, now Istanbul.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The real labour of love, however, came in 2016 when McPherson premiered It Is Easy To Be Dead.

      "  Five months on from the fire that destroyed the Mackintosh building, a long road of recovery still lies ahead for the businesses on Sauchiehall Street. The scale of the impact was laid out starkly by business owners at the most recent Sauchiehall Street Task Force meeting. Many of the businesses have not yet reopened and for those that have turnover is sharply down on normal patterns.\n",

      "  One of the more unfortunate features has been the fire’s occurrence right in the middle of the building contract for the transformation of the street into Glasgow’s first Avenue. That project will radically improve the street’s look and feel but involves redesign, ripping up and relaying virtually the entire surface. The building contractors’ flexibility in the aftermath of the fire was widely praised but combining the impact of that project with a major incident has been the perfect storm.\n",

      "  The businesses on the street are unsurprisingly dismayed that normal trade has not yet returned. Thankfully the Avenue project is ahead of schedule and should be very largely complete before the end of the year.

      "  There is appreciation for the Council officials who have been on the street offering advice and tackling the practical issues but frustration it has taken so long to clarify the timelines for dealing with damaged buildings. Businesses welcomed the Scottish Government’s financial support and are very keen to draw on the full fund offered to help the street recover. They are wondering why the UK Government has not yet followed through on the promises of support made immediately after the fire.\n",

These aren’t the paranoid fantasies of liberals driven mad by Donald Trump in the White House, these are the fears of conservative scholars like Victor Davis Hanson of Stanford University’s Hoover Institute – a man who voted twice for George W Bush. Writing in the conservative National Review, Professor Hanson said that the US had”‘arrived at the brink of a veritable civil war”.\\n', '\\n  “Whether we all take a deep breath, and understand our present dangerous trajectory, will determine whether 2019 becomes 1861,” he wrote. By 1865, after four years of fighting, the civil war had claimed more American lives than any other conflict before or since.\\n', '\\n  The echoes of the civil war are everywhere. As Mr Trump ordered American troops to the US-Mexico border to deal with a “caravan” of impoverished men, women and children from Honduras, seeking a new life in America, the President turned his ire on the 14th amendment of the constitution which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the States. Written in the aftermath of the civil war, it was expressly conceived to give equal protection under the law to former slaves.\\n', '\\n  Mr Trump is putting a crowbar into a fault-line in American life, and wrenching it open – playing to those who see “citizenship” and “white” as the same thing. The dog whistle of the 14th amendment is as alluring to a white supremacist as the word “globalist” is to an anti-Semite.\\n', '\\n  Civil conflict, though, isn’t the only dread haunting American voters as they cast their ballot in today’s crucial midterm elections – there is talk in the US every week of a slow-moving coup, of the rise of fascism, of a country so sundered it can never be put back together again. Yesterday, the great American novelist Don DeLillo said he doubted his country could recover from the Trump presidency. The truth is: America is already in a state of cold war with itself.\\n']\n",

      "['\\n  WHETHER it’s a Scottish politician praising legislation designed to curtail the reproductive rights of the poor or a Westminster front bench giving vociferous support to what are seen as poverty-inducing benefit reforms, the Tories are doing a great job of living up to their image as a nasty party whose sympathies lie only with the privileged few.\\n', '\\n  Thank goodness for Tracey Crouch, then, the Conservative MP for Chatham and Aylesford who resigned as sports minister last week in protest at what she said was an “unjustifiable” delay to a policy aimed at tackling the scourge of problem gambling. Having long campaigned for the maximum bet that can be placed via bookie-shop slot machines to be reduced from £100 to £2, Ms Crouch said she was taking a stand after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the change will be introduced in October next year and not April as she had been expecting.\\n', '\\n  The effects of this, she said, will be profound, with £1.6 billion expected to be lost on these machines between May 2018, when the reduction was agreed, and October 2019, when it will now take effect. Worse still, she wrote in her resignation letter, “a significant amount” of the total will be lost “in our most deprived areas”.\\n', '\\n  It is no secret that gambling and hardship go hand in hand, with the Scottish Government as long ago as 2006 issuing a report that found that “disadvantaged social groups who experience poverty, unemployment, dependence on welfare, and low levels of education and household income are most likely to suffer the adverse consequences of increased gambling”. The clustering of betting shops in areas of deprivation such as Glasgow’s Dumbarton Road has long been a cause for concern and that report, which was written by University of Glasgow professor Gerda Reith, whose research focuses on problematic forms of consumption, also found that “availability and convenience are strongly associated with problem gambling”.\\n', '\\n  Having been introduced after then Chancellor Gordon Brown abolished betting duties in 2001, the so-called fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) Ms Crouch has resigned over were still in their infancy when Professor Reith’s report was issued. In the years since, though, they have come to represent all that is wrong with the gambling industry, not least because they enable customers to place £100 bets every 20 seconds, leading some to lose thousands in a single sitting.\\n']\n",

      "['\\nCeltic fans will be purring with delight after Saturday’s comprehensive demolition of Hearts saw the club fire home 13 goals in their last three domestic games. Brendan Rodgers’ side look back to their absolute best and there’s seemingly very little any other team in Scotland can do to stop it.\\n', '\\n  One, notable factor in each of these last three games has been the introduction of Ryan Christie to the Celtic midfield. The Inverness-born talent was no more than an afterthought in the club’s summer transfer window, yet slowly but surely he’s worked his way in to Rodgers’ plans and has grasped the recent opportunity to prove his worth in green and white with both hands.\\n', '\\n  Indeed, Christie has played all but one half of Celtic’s last four games and in that select period of time the 23-year-old has picked up no less than three goals and two assists. Leading many - perhaps even his manager - to wonder whether the former Aberdeen loanee does in fact have a long-term role to play at the Glasgow club.\\n', '\\n  Christie’s speed, strength and sheer determination to dart through the middle of the pitch with or without the ball has led to an inevitable comparison with Stuart Armstrong. Not only has the young Scot obviously featured in his predecessor’s natural position for Rodgers’ side, but when we consider what he brings to this Celtic team there are fair comparisons to be made.\\n', '\\n  Taking Armstrong’s stats from the 2016/17 season (He was mostly injured or disinterested in 2017/18) we can see that Christie’s brief run in the Celtic team this season are not only comparable to the former midfield star’s, but at times even better.\\n']\n",

      "['\\n  OLD Goldenballs himself couldn’t have struck it any better. David Beckham versus Greece, Leigh Griffiths versus England (x2); it takes a special mixture of technique and temperament to deliver on a free-kick when the world seems to be watching and for Lewis Ferguson right now everything seems to be coming up roses. Aberdeen’s 19-year-old midfield wonder kid might have had more attention on him than usual when he stepped up in the dying minutes of his side’s come-from-behind 2-1 win against Kilmarnock at Rugby Park on Sunday but yet again he proved he was a man for the big occasion. Shrugging off the claim to Gary Mackay-Steven to steer a right foot shot into the corner of Jamie MacDonald’s net, Ferguson afterwards paid tribute to the painstaking work he does with Aberdeen coach Barry Robson after training, a man who could hit a pretty mean free kick instead.\\n', '\\n  “Usually I fight with Niall [McGinn] for the free kicks,” said Ferguson. “But credit to Barry Robson. He stays out with me for about half an hour after training and we just practise free kicks. He was a good free-kick taker so he gives me loads of tips. It’s always me or Niall. I don’t think any of the other boys really fancy it. But I fancied that one and thankfully it went in the back of the net.”\\n', '\\n  With sources of goals in Alex McLeish’s Scotland team not quite so obvious right now with the likes of Steven Naismith and Leigh Griffiths posted missing, there was speculation yesterday as to whether Ferguson – the son of Rangers legend Derek – could even find himself fast-tracked into the full squad in time for the matches against Albania and Israel. That seems a little premature but, as he puts it himself, the big occasion certainly “doesn’t faze him”. He shrugged off the notion that the events of the week should somehow have taken anything out of him.\\n', '\\n  “Recovering mentally? I don’t really think much about it,” said Ferguson. “The big occasion doesn’t really faze me. The bigger the game, the bigger the occasion, I enjoy it even more. But physically it was tough. The semi-final on Sunday was a later kick-off and then we had to recover in time for the game against Hamilton. I played 90 minutes there and then 90 minutes against Kilmarnock. It’s tough on the legs but Monday is a day off and then back to work on Tuesday.”\\n', '\\n  Aberdeen inched to seventh after what was a slow start to the season on the back of this scarcely-deserved 2-1 win, but the Ladbrokes Premiership is a marathon, not a sprint. After three big wins in a week, Ferguson for one sees no reason why they can’t overhaul early leaders Hearts to book a European berth. Take another three points on Friday night against Hibs and Aberdeen will suddenly be rocking.\\n']\n",

Writing in the conservative National Review, Professor Hanson said that the US had”‘arrived at the brink of a veritable civil war”.\\n', '\\n  “Whether we all take a deep breath, and understand our present dangerous trajectory, will determine whether 2019 becomes 1861,” he wrote.

As Mr Trump ordered American troops to the US-Mexico border to deal with a “caravan” of impoverished men, women and children from Honduras, seeking a new life in America, the President turned his ire on the 14th amendment of the constitution which guarantees citizenship to anyone born in the States. Written in the aftermath of the civil war, it was expressly conceived to give equal protection under the law to former slaves.\\n', '\\n  Mr Trump is putting a crowbar into a fault-line in American life, and wrenching it open – playing to those who see “citizenship” and “white” as the same thing.

Even if the debt were to be paid off over a period of 20 years where would the Exchequer find the £100 billion every year to do so? Perhaps by privatising the NHS and slashing social services? It already pays eight per cent of tax revenue on interest payments; does Mr Mowbray suggest it initially spends 25 per cent of our taxes to pay down the debt and to service the loan repayments? If not, Brexit or no Brexit the UK will drag the ball and chain of debt behind it for decades while the financial sector continues to siphon off some of the taxes paid by those fortunate to be in work and I and my contemporaries pay from our pensions simply because we had the wit to use part of our already-taxed income to pay into one.\\n', '\\n  Our economy relies too heavily on the service sector; it cannot be sustained by us selling pizzas to each other or a financial sector based on finding effective ways of hiding the Establishment’s wealth.

That description is supported by health organisations from NHS Scotland to the Royal College of Physicians.\\n', '\\n  But a study, funded by Cancer Research UK, and to be presented in Glasgow today at the 2018 National Cancer Research Institute Cancer Conference, makes interesting reading.Twenty-nine per cent of health professionals would not recommend e-cigarettes to cancer patients who already smoke. More than half of those surveyed did not know enough about e-cigarettes to make recommendations to patients. A quarter did not know whether e-cigarettes were less harmful than smoking. The researchers, with justification, say their findings indicate a need for clearer guidance and training for health professionals around endorsing e-cigarettes to cancer patients who smoke.\\n', '\\n  But concerns have been expressed that children and teenagers who have never smoked are turning to e-cigarettes, seeing them as “cool”, and drawn, at least in part, by the sweet or fruit flavours. The US Food and Drug Administration speaks of an “epidemic” among young people who are using the devices and are getting hooked on nicotine. A leading US manufacturer is to discontinue most of its flavoured e-cigarettes. A RAND Corporation study says that adolescents who vape are not only more likely to smoke cigarettes but are also likely to increase their use of both products eventually.

      "['\\nHannah McGill\\n', '\\n  PRIZE juries make their own choices. I’ve been on lots, and they’ve done some eccentric things. Still, the omission from the shortlists of our publicly funded literary awards of a singularly impactful and important Scottish book is a surprise and a headscratcher. Darren McGarvey’s Poverty Safari was first published by Edinburgh’s Luath Press, then picked up by Picador, then won the hugely prestigious Orwell Prize for political journalism. The Guardian praised its “honesty and wisdom”; the Financial Times called it “urgently written, articulate and emotional”; even the New York Times covered it. But the Saltire Awards didn’t progress it into serious contention – even though there are only four books on a Best First Book shortlist that has room for six, and even though Luath has been nominated in its Best Publisher Awards in part for its achievement in publishing it.\\n', '\\n  Again, prize juries make their own choices, and those don’t need to be accounted for as long as basic protocols have been followed, like the one where any jury member unable to be impartial due to personal connections to an entrant recuses him or herself from sitting in judgement of that work. The Saltire Society assures me that every book entered was judged on literary merit. And it’s true that having had such vast impact, and having represented and reached a sector of Scottish society not always visible in the literary world, didn’t guarantee Poverty Safari a place on the shortlist (although I would note that in the time I was a Saltire judge, we progressed many books on the basis that they just mattered too much to be chucked out at the first round).\\n', '\\n  This omission still gives pause, however. It follows several years when, despite a rising profile as a rapper and commentator prior to the publication of Poverty Safari, McGarvey wasn’t named in another rundown of significant Scottish cultural figures, the List magazine’s Hot 100. (He’s out again this year, since it’s all women, though an editorial note acknowledges the book’s prominence.) It makes you wonder about tall poppy syndrome, when a work so honoured elsewhere gets junked in its homeland. And it calls to mind the current fad for “no platforming” individuals whose viewpoint affronts particular sensibilities. McGarvey, after all, has got many backs up in the past, not least by querying how feminist discourse about “male privilege” is read by men who live in serious deprivation, and how poverty intersects with violence. (He knows a bit about this through the work he’s done with the Scottish Violence Reduction Unit.) Finally, and unfortunately, it reinforces an impression held by many: that our cultural gatekeepers don’t wish to hear from the wrong side of the tracks.\\n', '\\n  I don’t endorse the latter idea: it’s unfair to the countless Scottish artists and arts workers who had complicated routes into their fields and who certainly aren’t subsisting on foie gras now. (Indeed, for balance, I’d say that McGarvey’s work is flawed by his tendency to portray people not in poverty as an undifferentiated blob of smug privilege.) The Saltire Awards has certainly honoured writers from various backgrounds in the past. Still, this snub should function as a reminder to keep an eye on the gradient of the playing field. “I didn’t work this damn hard/To stay where I belong,” runs a lyric by Edinburgh band Young Fathers, another success story from Scotland’s unmoneyed tiers. We who have influence in culture must be vigilant that we’re not restricting where others feel they belong – and that personal animosities don’t pollute processes that are, after all, conducted on behalf of all of Scotland.\\n']\n",

Having long campaigned for the maximum bet that can be placed via bookie-shop slot machines to be reduced from £100 to £2, Ms Crouch said she was taking a stand after Chancellor Philip Hammond announced that the change will be introduced in October next year and not April as she had been expecting.\\n', '\\n  The effects of this, she said, will be profound, with £1.6 billion expected to be lost on these machines between May 2018, when the reduction was agreed, and October 2019, when it will now take effect. Worse still, she wrote in her resignation letter, “a significant amount” of the total will be lost “in our most deprived areas”.\\n', '\\n  It is no secret that gambling and hardship go hand in hand, with the Scottish Government as long ago as 2006 issuing a report that found that “disadvantaged social groups who experience poverty, unemployment, dependence on welfare, and low levels of education and household income are most likely to suffer the adverse consequences of increased gambling”. The clustering of betting shops in areas of deprivation such as Glasgow’s Dumbarton Road has long been a cause for concern and that report, which was written by University of Glasgow professor Gerda Reith, whose research focuses on problematic forms of consumption, also found that “availability and convenience are strongly associated with problem gambling”.\\n', '\\n  Having been introduced after then Chancellor Gordon Brown abolished betting duties in 2001, the so-called fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) Ms Crouch has resigned over were still in their infancy when Professor Reith’s report was issued.

That means that only very recently has work begun on assessing the damage to the O2 ABC complex upon which many of the local businesses depended for attracting trade.\\n', '\\n  One of the more unfortunate features has been the fire’s occurrence right in the middle of the building contract for the transformation of the street into Glasgow’s first Avenue. That project will radically improve the street’s look and feel but involves redesign, ripping up and relaying virtually the entire surface. The building contractors’ flexibility in the aftermath of the fire was widely praised but combining the impact of that project with a major incident has been the perfect storm.\\n', '\\n  The businesses on the street are unsurprisingly dismayed that normal trade has not yet returned. Thankfully the Avenue project is ahead of schedule and should be very largely complete before the end of the year. But by then many of the businesses will have struggled on through seven months of pain and very sadly some will not survive.\\n', '\\n  There is appreciation for the Council officials who have been on the street offering advice and tackling the practical issues but frustration it has taken so long to clarify the timelines for dealing with damaged buildings. Businesses welcomed the Scottish Government’s financial support and are very keen to draw on the full fund offered to help the street recover.
