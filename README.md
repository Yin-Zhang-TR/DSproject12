- Group meeting(14/ Oct/ 2018): Akshata/ Ching-Han (Helen)/ Yin/ Hu Liang (Brett) <br>  
Working with Yin to structure the MongoDB for Twitter Data and News Data. We have decided we need the following columns:  
News: <br> 
ID, URL. Title, Text, Source <br>  
Twitter Data: <br> 
ID, Text, Time, Hashtags, Screen Name, Name, URL, Geo Enabled, Locatio,Organization <br> 

## Questions:  
1. Do we need to store this like an entity:number for news?  
2. Do we need to collect the likes, retweets and comments for twitter data and for the news articles for twitter?  
3. How can all 4 of us have access to the same instance of MongoDB from our laptops?
