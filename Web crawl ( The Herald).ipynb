      "  WEST Virginia was in my thoughts yesterday. In the spring of 2006 I spent a lot of time there, hanging out at an armed neo-nazi compound. I remembered the US marine – freshly radicalised during a tour of Iraq – taking me to the compound’s heavily-stocked armoury and selecting an AK-47, shotgun and revolver to go shooting in the woods. The compound was owned by the National Alliance (NA) – then America’s most dangerous neo-nazi organisation. I remembered the NA warehouse, filled with millions of dollars of merchandise to be shipped around the world, items like a computer mouse mat bearing the legend “Got Jews? Try Zyklon B” – that’s the chemical used in the Nazi gas chambers – or a pair of skinhead boots with a swastika carved into the sole, so the wearer can leave victims with the imprint on their face after stamping on them. I remembered the young NA recruits and their computer game called Ethnic Cleansing where the player scores points killing Mexicans.\n",

      "\n",
      "  As a liberal film-maker, producing a documentary about the far right around the world, I was revolted by what I saw. But I was also horribly, fearfully, impressed – these people were deadly serious, they had money, weapons and a belief system more akin to a religious cult than a political party. They were also beginning to be listened to – that was the scariest part: their numbers were growing and more and more people were heeding them. I saw the same story unfold wherever making the film took me – in Germany, in Italy, at home in Britain, in the United States, the far right was gaining traction … but no-one really seemed to give a damn.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  On Sunday, though, things seemed to shift at home, as MI5 took over from the police in the fight against the far right in Britain. The switch showed that at last we are starting to take the violent threat from neo-nazis and their alt-right clones seriously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Let me be very clear: home-grown radical neo-nazis are as much a threat to western democracy as Islamist terror. I’ve not come to that belief idly, sitting in my armchair. For 27 years, I have investigated the far right across Europe and America, and watched as the movement grew and changed until we got to the place where we are today: with a president in the White House who behaves like a hate preacher radicalising his flock; with a growing cult around a dangerous charismatic extremist like Tommy Robinson; with a far right president in Brazil; with social democratic parties on the ropes across Europe as extremists gain both ground and legitimacy in the eyes of many voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Social democratic parties have no-one to blame but themselves – as they made the space that the far right now occupies. For decades, the Left and liberals would not talk about the fears over immigration that many white working-class communities felt – fears that could have been easily assuaged if the nation had tackled the matter head on. That silence was quickly filled up by extremists. Instead of a difficult but necessary conversation, most politicians tuned out, and so hate and lies were allowed to fester and take root. Voila, welcome to 2018.\n",

      "\n",
      "  The bank is painfully aware of this, of course, to the extent that it has even floated the idea of ditching the RBS moniker in favour of something less “tarnished”. While some within the organisation obviously believe that such a big gesture is necessary for RBS’s ongoing rehabilitation, other steps the bank is taking are likely to help it get there in less grandiose fashion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Indeed, you only have to take a look at the notes the bank has issued in the years since its near-collapse, all of which feature the image of a woman, to get an idea of the kind of organisation RBS would like to become. After putting writer Nan Shepherd on its £5 polymer note in 2016, the bank used an image of astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville for the £10 version it released a year later and has now followed that up by putting entrepreneur Kate Cranston of Willow Tearooms fame on its new-issue £20 note.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  After nearly 300 years in which only men - and well-connected men at that - were thought worthy of such an honour, you may think it is about time that women were given their turn. Coming as it does from an institution that just 10 years ago epitomised all that was wrong with the testosterone-fuelled macho world of business, though, this is about so much more than simply giving women a shot. It is about showing that RBS has changed into an entity that is not only self-aware but, crucially, is aware of the world it inhabits too.\n",

Instead, he has to preside over an economic crisis and prescribe more public spending.\n",

So here’s another: if there is an economic tidal wave coming, some of Mr Hammond’s critics thinks he’s facing it armed only with a sieve. The wave is Brexit of course and pretty much everyone – including Mr Hammond privately and often publicly as well – accepts the economy is going to be badly affected if there is a deal with the EU and even more badly affected if there isn’t.\n",

Last year I spent time speaking to the businesses along Sauchiehall Street and it was a depressing experience. There is a big new improvement scheme under way on Glasgow’s grand old street, but the fundamental problems aren’t going anywhere, as Philip Hammond said in his speech, the biggest being the costs high-street businesses have to endure and the shift to online. To an extent, we only have ourselves to blame for it – as the Chancellor pointed out, the British have adopted online shopping with greater alacrity than other European countries, but they have also adopted moaning about the state of the high street with just as much enthusiasm. We can’t have it both ways.\n",

      "  IT’S a troubling picture. A woman sits next to the corpse of a dead animal. There’s blood seeping from the animal’s neck. There’s a smile on the woman’s face. But this is not the notorious snapshot of the American hunter Larysa Switlyk with a dead goat – it’s a picture of a woman on the Invercauld estate in the Cairngorms with a dead deer. But has Twitter ever been shocked by this other woman with a dead animal? No. Did the First Minister order an investigation? No. Because that’s what happens when we start talking about animals. We all get a little bit hypocritical.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  If you want to see the picture of the other woman in the Cairngorms for yourself, and find out more about the kind of hunting that goes on there, you can take a look at www.invercauld.estate/shooting-stalking, and I urge you to do so because it underlines what actually happens in Scotland and the ludicrous nature of the reaction to Larysa Switlyk. People hunt in Scotland. And they take pictures of themselves doing it and always have done, so why were we so apparently shocked by Ms Switlyk? Was it the army-style fatigues she was wearing? Or the fact she was an American having the audacity to shoot Scottish animals? Or was it just that we judged her killing to be a little bit vulgar?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  I suspect at least some of the outrage of the last few days can be explained by these factors – in the age of Trump, Ms Switlyk’s behaviour felt like the kind of culturally-dumb American brazenness her president displays – but almost all of the Scottish reaction to her stank of hypocrisy. The chances are that most of those tweeting their outrage are meat-eaters, which makes their shock hard to take. A goat is killed on an island and a cow is killed in an abattoir. What, exactly, is the difference, other than the fact that one is public and the other is hidden? Alex Hogg, the chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, put it rather well in his reaction to the Islay furore. What, he asked, makes one type of killing different from another?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  The reaction of the Scottish Government to all of this was also inconsistent. The First Minister (a carnivore who’s fond of bacon sandwiches) said on Twitter that she understood why the images from Islay were upsetting; she also said her government would consider whether there should be a change to the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  But what kind of change exactly? A change so that Americans cannot take pictures of themselves doing something that’s legal? More than that: people like Ms Switlyk are doing something that is supported by the Scottish Government itself: feral goats are killed on properties owned by Scottish Natural Heritage, which is a government agency. In other words, the Government is making money from the thing that Nicola Sturgeon was offended by in her tweet.\n",

I remembered the US marine – freshly radicalised during a tour of Iraq – taking me to the compound’s heavily-stocked armoury and selecting an AK-47, shotgun and revolver to go shooting in the woods. The compound was owned by the National Alliance (NA) – then America’s most dangerous neo-nazi organisation. I remembered the NA warehouse, filled with millions of dollars of merchandise to be shipped around the world, items like a computer mouse mat bearing the legend “Got Jews? Try Zyklon B” – that’s the chemical used in the Nazi gas chambers – or a pair of skinhead boots with a swastika carved into the sole, so the wearer can leave victims with the imprint on their face after stamping on them.

They were also beginning to be listened to – that was the scariest part: their numbers were growing and more and more people were heeding them. I saw the same story unfold wherever making the film took me – in Germany, in Italy, at home in Britain, in the United States, the far right was gaining traction … but no-one really seemed to give a damn.\n",

      "  Let me be very clear: home-grown radical neo-nazis are as much a threat to western democracy as Islamist terror. I’ve not come to that belief idly, sitting in my armchair. For 27 years, I have investigated the far right across Europe and America, and watched as the movement grew and changed until we got to the place where we are today: with a president in the White House who behaves like a hate preacher radicalising his flock; with a growing cult around a dangerous charismatic extremist like Tommy Robinson; with a far right president in Brazil; with social democratic parties on the ropes across Europe as extremists gain both ground and legitimacy in the eyes of many voters.\n",

For decades, the Left and liberals would not talk about the fears over immigration that many white working-class communities felt – fears that could have been easily assuaged if the nation had tackled the matter head on. That silence was quickly filled up by extremists. Instead of a difficult but necessary conversation, most politicians tuned out, and so hate and lies were allowed to fester and take root.

Peter A Russell (Letters, October 27) must have truly heroic figures of increased taxation in Scotland if any Holyrood government were to attempt to ameliorate Scotland’s share of those cuts. I have friends who were social workers in Glasgow during the period he mentions, and poverty in that Labour city was extreme and widespread. I was also a miner on strike for a year, in the mid-1980s, and while we could borrow money (paid back after the end of the strike) from Strathclyde Region, Labour councils did very little to help increasingly impoverished mining families.\n",

I worked in the last two deep mines in Ayrshire and these pit closures lost probably 10,000 local jobs, with very little other industry to fall back on in mostly small towns and villages. Auchinleck and New Cumnock were reduced to a a state of near dereliction, with many skilled men forced to leave to find work elsewhere (New Cumnock lost one-third of its population). Strathclyde also decanted drug addicts from Glasgow down to Cumnock, looking to break the connection with their suppliers.

There is a big new improvement scheme under way on Glasgow’s grand old street, but the fundamental problems aren’t going anywhere, as Philip Hammond said in his speech, the biggest being the costs high-street businesses have to endure and the shift to online. To an extent, we only have ourselves to blame for it – as the Chancellor pointed out, the British have adopted online shopping with greater alacrity than other European countries, but they have also adopted moaning about the state of the high street with just as much enthusiasm.

Not acceptable. Most of us cannot afford to seek private help and should not need to when we have our NHS.\n",

The form’s heyday was the 1970s. This was the era of the critic as opinion former, the maker or breaker of movies. Roger Ebert (who won a Pulitzer in 1975), Pauline Kael, and Philip French, all sadly departed, were among those who made the job respectable, and covetable.\n",

      "['\\n  WEST Virginia was in my thoughts yesterday. In the spring of 2006 I spent a lot of time there, hanging out at an armed neo-nazi compound. I remembered the US marine – freshly radicalised during a tour of Iraq – taking me to the compound’s heavily-stocked armoury and selecting an AK-47, shotgun and revolver to go shooting in the woods. The compound was owned by the National Alliance (NA) – then America’s most dangerous neo-nazi organisation. I remembered the NA warehouse, filled with millions of dollars of merchandise to be shipped around the world, items like a computer mouse mat bearing the legend “Got Jews? Try Zyklon B” – that’s the chemical used in the Nazi gas chambers – or a pair of skinhead boots with a swastika carved into the sole, so the wearer can leave victims with the imprint on their face after stamping on them. I remembered the young NA recruits and their computer game called Ethnic Cleansing where the player scores points killing Mexicans.\\n', '\\n  As a liberal film-maker, producing a documentary about the far right around the world, I was revolted by what I saw. But I was also horribly, fearfully, impressed – these people were deadly serious, they had money, weapons and a belief system more akin to a religious cult than a political party. They were also beginning to be listened to – that was the scariest part: their numbers were growing and more and more people were heeding them. I saw the same story unfold wherever making the film took me – in Germany, in Italy, at home in Britain, in the United States, the far right was gaining traction … but no-one really seemed to give a damn.\\n', '\\n  On Sunday, though, things seemed to shift at home, as MI5 took over from the police in the fight against the far right in Britain. The switch showed that at last we are starting to take the violent threat from neo-nazis and their alt-right clones seriously.\\n', '\\n  Let me be very clear: home-grown radical neo-nazis are as much a threat to western democracy as Islamist terror. I’ve not come to that belief idly, sitting in my armchair. For 27 years, I have investigated the far right across Europe and America, and watched as the movement grew and changed until we got to the place where we are today: with a president in the White House who behaves like a hate preacher radicalising his flock; with a growing cult around a dangerous charismatic extremist like Tommy Robinson; with a far right president in Brazil; with social democratic parties on the ropes across Europe as extremists gain both ground and legitimacy in the eyes of many voters.\\n', '\\n  Social democratic parties have no-one to blame but themselves – as they made the space that the far right now occupies. For decades, the Left and liberals would not talk about the fears over immigration that many white working-class communities felt – fears that could have been easily assuaged if the nation had tackled the matter head on. That silence was quickly filled up by extremists. Instead of a difficult but necessary conversation, most politicians tuned out, and so hate and lies were allowed to fester and take root. Voila, welcome to 2018.\\n']\n",

      "['\\n  ROYAL Bank of Scotland has been in the public eye for all the wrong reasons in recent years, with everything from a government bailout to the decidedly dodgy behaviour of its business restructuring unit doing nothing to enhance its image.\\n', '\\n  The bank is painfully aware of this, of course, to the extent that it has even floated the idea of ditching the RBS moniker in favour of something less “tarnished”. While some within the organisation obviously believe that such a big gesture is necessary for RBS’s ongoing rehabilitation, other steps the bank is taking are likely to help it get there in less grandiose fashion.\\n', '\\n  Indeed, you only have to take a look at the notes the bank has issued in the years since its near-collapse, all of which feature the image of a woman, to get an idea of the kind of organisation RBS would like to become. After putting writer Nan Shepherd on its £5 polymer note in 2016, the bank used an image of astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville for the £10 version it released a year later and has now followed that up by putting entrepreneur Kate Cranston of Willow Tearooms fame on its new-issue £20 note.\\n', '\\n  After nearly 300 years in which only men - and well-connected men at that - were thought worthy of such an honour, you may think it is about time that women were given their turn. Coming as it does from an institution that just 10 years ago epitomised all that was wrong with the testosterone-fuelled macho world of business, though, this is about so much more than simply giving women a shot. It is about showing that RBS has changed into an entity that is not only self-aware but, crucially, is aware of the world it inhabits too.\\n', '\\n  For too long the notes printed and distributed by banks have given the impression that that world is one where only men matter, or at least where only men’s achievements are worth taking note of. As journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez said when challenging the Bank of England’s 2013 decision to replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on its £5 notes: “An all-male line-up on our banknotes sends out the damaging message that no woman has done anything important enough to appear.”\\n']\n",

      "['\\n  This budget should be seen for what it is: the latest episode of a Conservative Party drama in which everyone is cast in the wrong role. Philip Hammond would like to be playing a traditional Conservative chancellor being sensible with the public’s money and making big cuts to tax. Instead, he has to preside over an economic crisis and prescribe more public spending.\\n', '\\n  His fellow actors in the economic drama are similarly miscast. Theresa May is a Remainer playing a Brexiter. Boris Johnson thinks he should be playing the lead role but is forced to be in the chorus. About the only Tory in the right role is the bad guy: Jacob Rees-Mogg, in tailored black.\\n', '\\n  If you think I’ve taken that metaphor too far, this is the Budget - people expect metaphors. So here’s another: if there is an economic tidal wave coming, some of Mr Hammond’s critics thinks he’s facing it armed only with a sieve. The wave is Brexit of course and pretty much everyone – including Mr Hammond privately and often publicly as well – accepts the economy is going to be badly affected if there is a deal with the EU and even more badly affected if there isn’t.\\n', '\\n  This is why Mr Hammond has been forced to play the role for which he is ill-suited: the big spender. The budget announced more money for schools, hospitals, veterans, potholes, policing and apprenticeships among other things, but it was the money for the high street that arguably has the potential to make the greatest day-to-day difference to most of us.\\n', '\\n  We all know the problem he’s trying to tackle because we’ve all been down a high street in the last few years and seen the To Let signs, the shutters, the bookies and the pound shops (and even some of those are closing down). Last year I spent time speaking to the businesses along Sauchiehall Street and it was a depressing experience. There is a big new improvement scheme under way on Glasgow’s grand old street, but the fundamental problems aren’t going anywhere, as Philip Hammond said in his speech, the biggest being the costs high-street businesses have to endure and the shift to online. To an extent, we only have ourselves to blame for it – as the Chancellor pointed out, the British have adopted online shopping with greater alacrity than other European countries, but they have also adopted moaning about the state of the high street with just as much enthusiasm. We can’t have it both ways.\\n']\n",

Just as the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, was attempting to wax lyrically on 1962, the last time a Budget had been delivered on a Monday, a voice from the Labour benches boomed: “ OH GERRONWITHIT!”\\n', '\\n  Even as the minutes ticked by and the hour mark came and went, one began to wonder why Mr Hammond had bothered with this Budget at all. He had major announcements to make, on the abolition of PFI and a tax on digital companies to name but two, but these could have been delivered at any time.\\n', '\\n  As a result, he sounded less like a Chancellor delivering a coherent Budget than a politician filling time before the main event. For once, we do not mean the next Tory leadership contest. The main event, the only event, last month, next month, and for the foreseeable future, is Brexit.\\n', '\\n  When he did refer to the UK exiting the EU on March 29 next year it was to say he was putting slightly more money into the pot to deal with contingencies. The only nod to the enormity of what will soon be taking place was when he referred to the possibility of upgrading next year’s Spring Statement to a “full fiscal event” if necessary.\\n', '\\n  In other words, should the UK look like it will crash out of the EU without a deal – good, bad, or middling – Mr Hammond may have to revise his plans entirely. How he squares this with promises that the spending increases announced yesterday will go ahead regardless of the Brexit deal is difficult to see. A no deal Brexit will change everything, utterly.\\n']\n",

But this is not the notorious snapshot of the American hunter Larysa Switlyk with a dead goat – it’s a picture of a woman on the Invercauld estate in the Cairngorms with a dead deer. But has Twitter ever been shocked by this other woman with a dead animal? No. Did the First Minister order an investigation? No. Because that’s what happens when we start talking about animals. We all get a little bit hypocritical.\\n', '\\n  If you want to see the picture of the other woman in the Cairngorms for yourself, and find out more about the kind of hunting that goes on there, you can take a look at www.invercauld.estate/shooting-stalking, and I urge you to do so because it underlines what actually happens in Scotland and the ludicrous nature of the reaction to Larysa Switlyk. People hunt in Scotland. And they take pictures of themselves doing it and always have done, so why were we so apparently shocked by Ms Switlyk? Was it the army-style fatigues she was wearing? Or the fact she was an American having the audacity to shoot Scottish animals? Or was it just that we judged her killing to be a little bit vulgar?\\n', '\\n  I suspect at least some of the outrage of the last few days can be explained by these factors – in the age of Trump, Ms Switlyk’s behaviour felt like the kind of culturally-dumb American brazenness her president displays – but almost all of the Scottish reaction to her stank of hypocrisy. The chances are that most of those tweeting their outrage are meat-eaters, which makes their shock hard to take. A goat is killed on an island and a cow is killed in an abattoir. What, exactly, is the difference, other than the fact that one is public and the other is hidden? Alex Hogg, the chairman of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, put it rather well in his reaction to the Islay furore. What, he asked, makes one type of killing different from another?\\n', '\\n  The reaction of the Scottish Government to all of this was also inconsistent. The First Minister (a carnivore who’s fond of bacon sandwiches) said on Twitter that she understood why the images from Islay were upsetting; she also said her government would consider whether there should be a change to the law.\\n', '\\n  But what kind of change exactly? A change so that Americans cannot take pictures of themselves doing something that’s legal? More than that: people like Ms Switlyk are doing something that is supported by the Scottish Government itself: feral goats are killed on properties owned by Scottish Natural Heritage, which is a government agency. In other words, the Government is making money from the thing that Nicola Sturgeon was offended by in her tweet.\\n']\n",

      "['\\n  WEST Virginia was in my thoughts yesterday. In the spring of 2006 I spent a lot of time there, hanging out at an armed neo-nazi compound. I remembered the US marine – freshly radicalised during a tour of Iraq – taking me to the compound’s heavily-stocked armoury and selecting an AK-47, shotgun and revolver to go shooting in the woods. The compound was owned by the National Alliance (NA) – then America’s most dangerous neo-nazi organisation. I remembered the NA warehouse, filled with millions of dollars of merchandise to be shipped around the world, items like a computer mouse mat bearing the legend “Got Jews? Try Zyklon B” – that’s the chemical used in the Nazi gas chambers – or a pair of skinhead boots with a swastika carved into the sole, so the wearer can leave victims with the imprint on their face after stamping on them. I remembered the young NA recruits and their computer game called Ethnic Cleansing where the player scores points killing Mexicans.\\n', '\\n  As a liberal film-maker, producing a documentary about the far right around the world, I was revolted by what I saw. But I was also horribly, fearfully, impressed – these people were deadly serious, they had money, weapons and a belief system more akin to a religious cult than a political party. They were also beginning to be listened to – that was the scariest part: their numbers were growing and more and more people were heeding them. I saw the same story unfold wherever making the film took me – in Germany, in Italy, at home in Britain, in the United States, the far right was gaining traction … but no-one really seemed to give a damn.\\n', '\\n  On Sunday, though, things seemed to shift at home, as MI5 took over from the police in the fight against the far right in Britain. The switch showed that at last we are starting to take the violent threat from neo-nazis and their alt-right clones seriously.\\n', '\\n  Let me be very clear: home-grown radical neo-nazis are as much a threat to western democracy as Islamist terror. I’ve not come to that belief idly, sitting in my armchair. For 27 years, I have investigated the far right across Europe and America, and watched as the movement grew and changed until we got to the place where we are today: with a president in the White House who behaves like a hate preacher radicalising his flock; with a growing cult around a dangerous charismatic extremist like Tommy Robinson; with a far right president in Brazil; with social democratic parties on the ropes across Europe as extremists gain both ground and legitimacy in the eyes of many voters.\\n', '\\n  Social democratic parties have no-one to blame but themselves – as they made the space that the far right now occupies. For decades, the Left and liberals would not talk about the fears over immigration that many white working-class communities felt – fears that could have been easily assuaged if the nation had tackled the matter head on. That silence was quickly filled up by extremists. Instead of a difficult but necessary conversation, most politicians tuned out, and so hate and lies were allowed to fester and take root.

      "['\\n  ROYAL Bank of Scotland has been in the public eye for all the wrong reasons in recent years, with everything from a government bailout to the decidedly dodgy behaviour of its business restructuring unit doing nothing to enhance its image.\\n', '\\n  The bank is painfully aware of this, of course, to the extent that it has even floated the idea of ditching the RBS moniker in favour of something less “tarnished”. While some within the organisation obviously believe that such a big gesture is necessary for RBS’s ongoing rehabilitation, other steps the bank is taking are likely to help it get there in less grandiose fashion.\\n', '\\n  Indeed, you only have to take a look at the notes the bank has issued in the years since its near-collapse, all of which feature the image of a woman, to get an idea of the kind of organisation RBS would like to become. After putting writer Nan Shepherd on its £5 polymer note in 2016, the bank used an image of astronomer and mathematician Mary Somerville for the £10 version it released a year later and has now followed that up by putting entrepreneur Kate Cranston of Willow Tearooms fame on its new-issue £20 note.\\n', '\\n  After nearly 300 years in which only men - and well-connected men at that - were thought worthy of such an honour, you may think it is about time that women were given their turn. Coming as it does from an institution that just 10 years ago epitomised all that was wrong with the testosterone-fuelled macho world of business, though, this is about so much more than simply giving women a shot. It is about showing that RBS has changed into an entity that is not only self-aware but, crucially, is aware of the world it inhabits too.\\n', '\\n  For too long the notes printed and distributed by banks have given the impression that that world is one where only men matter, or at least where only men’s achievements are worth taking note of. As journalist and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez said when challenging the Bank of England’s 2013 decision to replace prison reformer Elizabeth Fry with Winston Churchill on its £5 notes: “An all-male line-up on our banknotes sends out the damaging message that no woman has done anything important enough to appear.”\\n']\n",

Peter A Russell (Letters, October 27) must have truly heroic figures of increased taxation in Scotland if any Holyrood government were to attempt to ameliorate Scotland’s share of those cuts. I have friends who were social workers in Glasgow during the period he mentions, and poverty in that Labour city was extreme and widespread. I was also a miner on strike for a year, in the mid-1980s, and while we could borrow money (paid back after the end of the strike) from Strathclyde Region, Labour councils did very little to help increasingly impoverished mining families.\\n', '\\n  People need decent jobs to escape poverty. A life on the benefits breadline is not what is wanted. In any case Labour has repeatedly abstained on Tory welfare bills, even at one point claiming cuts “did not go far enough”. I worked in the last two deep mines in Ayrshire and these pit closures lost probably 10,000 local jobs, with very little other industry to fall back on in mostly small towns and villages. Auchinleck and New Cumnock were reduced to a a state of near dereliction, with many skilled men forced to leave to find work elsewhere (New Cumnock lost one-third of its population). Strathclyde also decanted drug addicts from Glasgow down to Cumnock, looking to break the connection with their suppliers. Sadly the “dealers” followed them down, leading to a huge addiction problem here now.\\n', '\\n  The Tories did nothing to attract new industry in East Ayrshire (I have read that £800 million was spent on bring and maintaining Nissan in the north-east of England), and when Labour came to power it did virtually nothing either. Ayrshire has gone from a Labour heartland to a Labour desert in one generation, because of Labour’s abject failure to use the power of government at UK and Scottish level to maintain a decent standard of living for their electorate, when it had the chance.\\n', '\\n  GR Weir,\\n', '\\n  17 Mill Street, Ochiltree.\\n']\n",

The job is defined by long hours, personal risk, low pay and bullying bosses. Back in 2009, three years before Uber arrived, Police Scotland said 15 minicab firms were under the control of organised crime.

      "['\\n  This budget should be seen for what it is: the latest episode of a Conservative Party drama in which everyone is cast in the wrong role. Philip Hammond would like to be playing a traditional Conservative chancellor being sensible with the public’s money and making big cuts to tax. Instead, he has to preside over an economic crisis and prescribe more public spending.\\n', '\\n  His fellow actors in the economic drama are similarly miscast. Theresa May is a Remainer playing a Brexiter. Boris Johnson thinks he should be playing the lead role but is forced to be in the chorus. About the only Tory in the right role is the bad guy: Jacob Rees-Mogg, in tailored black.\\n', '\\n  If you think I’ve taken that metaphor too far, this is the Budget - people expect metaphors. So here’s another: if there is an economic tidal wave coming, some of Mr Hammond’s critics thinks he’s facing it armed only with a sieve. The wave is Brexit of course and pretty much everyone – including Mr Hammond privately and often publicly as well – accepts the economy is going to be badly affected if there is a deal with the EU and even more badly affected if there isn’t.\\n', '\\n  This is why Mr Hammond has been forced to play the role for which he is ill-suited: the big spender. The budget announced more money for schools, hospitals, veterans, potholes, policing and apprenticeships among other things, but it was the money for the high street that arguably has the potential to make the greatest day-to-day difference to most of us.\\n', '\\n  We all know the problem he’s trying to tackle because we’ve all been down a high street in the last few years and seen the To Let signs, the shutters, the bookies and the pound shops (and even some of those are closing down). Last year I spent time speaking to the businesses along Sauchiehall Street and it was a depressing experience. There is a big new improvement scheme under way on Glasgow’s grand old street, but the fundamental problems aren’t going anywhere, as Philip Hammond said in his speech, the biggest being the costs high-street businesses have to endure and the shift to online. To an extent, we only have ourselves to blame for it – as the Chancellor pointed out, the British have adopted online shopping with greater alacrity than other European countries, but they have also adopted moaning about the state of the high street with just as much enthusiasm. We can’t have it both ways.\\n']\n",

For this, I am grateful that those in the public eye speak out loud and clear. However, I have concerns.\\n', '\\n  First, though not for a minute doubting their pain and their good intentions in speaking out, these celeerities all tend to have come through the darkness and to have been fortunate enough to be successful in their work. They are rare and fortunate in so doing. This is an unrealistic expectation for many of us more ordinary black dog dancers.\\n', '\\n  Secondly, it is vital that sufferers are encouraged to seek help. However, and Sanjeev Kohli acknowledges this, gathering up the courage to seek help – and it does take both courage and desperation – does not mean that help is immediately forthcoming. Most of us resist reaching out until we reach crisis point. Sadly, help is then often not available with long waiting lists to see specialist mental health staff when really that input is needed within hours or days not weeks or months. This is especially true as antidepressant medication is no quick fix, taking several weeks at the earliest to have an effect.\\n', '\\n  Thirdly, whilst there are many excellent professionals and I have been grateful enough to have encountered several, there are sadly others who are out of touch and do more harm than good. For example, I have seen a psychiatrist obsessed with sex, one fed up with bored white middle-aged housewives, one of the pull-your-socks-up brigade and a community mental health nurse who tried to sell me supplements. Not acceptable. Most of us cannot afford to seek private help and should not need to when we have our NHS.\\n']\n",

Winners will have their reviews published in The Herald and receive a film goodie bag.\\n', '\\n  There have been film critics as long as there have been films. Rumour has it when the first feature film, The Story of the Kelly Gang, arrived in 1906, there was a critic on hand to welcome it into the world with a sneer and two stars. The form’s heyday was the 1970s. This was the era of the critic as opinion former, the maker or breaker of movies. Roger Ebert (who won a Pulitzer in 1975), Pauline Kael, and Philip French, all sadly departed, were among those who made the job respectable, and covetable.\\n', '\\n  Today, the business has changed out of all recognition.
